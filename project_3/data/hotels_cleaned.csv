hotels,"Double booking + egregious hotel cancellation policy! HELP, what can I do? I made a huge mistake booking a hotel for an upcoming trip to Tokyo with my two kids. I made a reservation on [booking.com](https://booking.com) for a total of about $3000 for 6 nights in a large chain hotel, which is more than I could afford, but our dates are in high season and almost everything was sold out when I started looking in January. The hotel offered free cancellation until March 3, so I felt safe in having a backup while I looked for something cheaper. Soon after I did find something cheaper, less than $1500 for the same 6 nights, in the same hotel in the same type of room, but on a different travel website. That also offered free cancellation, so I went ahead and booked it. 

Here comes my grave mistake: my son got covid and then I caught it from him and we were both sick and I forgot to cancel the first reservation during the free cancellation period. Today I went on [booking.com](https://booking.com) to do so, and was informed that the cancellation fee is the full price of the trip, i.e. $3000. I asked for them to waive the fee, thinking that it's 3 weeks out, and it's high season so they'll have no problem rebooking the room. They said no. I have the option to cancel the reservation and be charged the entire fee, or to keep the reservation.

I am a single mom who saved up and pinched pennies to be able to take my kids on this trip that we have all dreamed of, so it's not like I can say ""Oh well, I'll cancel the second reservation and just pay an extra $1400 for the exact same room booked on the first reservation."" 

The way I see it, I have two options to try to avoid paying for the more expensive reservation:

1. I cancel the credit card I used for the [booking.com](https://booking.com) reservation, and then cancel the booking and ignore it when they ask for a new card after the charge is declined. Then I show up at the same hotel on the same reservation date and try to check in under the other booking, hoping they haven't made the connection to the failed cancellation.
2. I don't cancel the first booking and just show up at the hotel and try to check in under the second booking, that is already paid for BTW. But will they see two bookings and not allow me to do this, and they will force me to pay for both rooms, or cancel the second booking and keep the money?

I feel angry at myself for not reading the small print when I booked the ""free cancellation/pay when you arrive at the hotel"" room on [booking.com](https://booking.com). I don't travel much and I had absolutely no idea that a hotel would charge me for the full stay when a room is canceled so far in advance. (And, for reasons I cannot understand, the hotel's cancellation policy on the second travel website is a fee of 1 night's charge!) I'm in such a bind now, and I'm going to be losing a lot of sleep over this unless I find a solution.

What should I do?"

When I went to check in, they told me I had 2 reservations and could not cancel one of them because it was booked through third party. 

The hotel is charging me 1 night of ""no show."" Could they have kept my third party booking and cancelled the direct booking for me to avoid the fee? Do I have any recourse? Would the hotel give me a credit instead or is that money lost?

hotels,"sick during hotel stay So I'm at a beautiful hotel right now. My stay here is supposed to be until Friday. I just woke up with a headache and sore throat. 

People working in hotels, what are my options here? I don't have a covid test with me so that's a possibility. I did have covid in December though so most likely it's just a cold.

I would preferably simply stay and utilise their room service. At home, I would have to cook for myself and take care of other household things, so staying sounds better to me. Is that an option or would that put the employees here in a bad spot? Can I ask for a covid test and go from there?"

hotels,"Room not ready past check-in time - am I in the wrong? (TLDR at the end) Hello everyone! Had a bit of a weird experience attempting to check in with a hotel the other day and wanted to get people’s views on whether there was anything I could have done differently. 

My husband and I are on our honeymoon in Mexico. We booked with an IOH hotel as part of our road trip - made the booking direct and well in advance. The hotel isn’t luxury but isn’t cheap either. We had an extremely long journey and arrived at 1pm - tried to check in, ‘sorry check in is from 3pm’ - no bother at all, I’m used to being able to check in early in the UK but rules are rules. 

We went out, came back at 3.02pm. ‘Sorry, we don’t currently have a room available, you can have another room that’ll have two beds (ie twin room), or you can wait’. It’s our honeymoon so we don’t want separate beds and agreed to wait. 

Waited for an hour in the lobby to no avail. Went back to the desk at 4pm - ‘sorry we still have no room, I can move you to a room without a bath and just a shower’ - by that point I’m exhausted and we’d been out in sweltering heat for much of the day so I say sure, go for it. Staff at reception says ok, give me 2 minutes. 10 more minutes pass, I look over and nothing is happening at the desk. I come over again - ‘sorry the system isn’t currently letting me move the room so you have to wait a bit longer’. 

At this point I’m so desperate for a shower and a bed that I just want to know if and when I’m going to be able to get to the room. I ask if they could please tell me, and if it is any longer than 10-15 minutes more I’d rather they cancelled and we just go to a different hotel. They can’t really give an answer. Both sides have a bit of a language barrier which is tricky, so we ask if it was possible to speak to the manager or someone else - politely - to see if we can figure it out with them. ‘The manager is not available’. At this stage I just say ok - understand it’s not your fault but please could you just cancel the reservation and we will go somewhere else. 

The guy at the desk says I have to cancel it myself on the website - I explain that if I do that I get charged a cancellation fee for one night which doesn’t feel very fair. In the end second staff at reception who wasn’t involved up to this point just says we’ll cancel it for you and we went somewhere else - both staff seemed pretty aggravated with us. 

For context, reception was completely empty. There was only one more gentleman ahead of us who also got told he can have a room with two beds which he opted for. Not seen a single other soul checking in in the time we were there. Husband and I were frustrated between ourselves but polite to hotel staff. 

Am I the asshole? What else could I have done beyond waiting an unspecified amount of time? Under different circumstances I probably would have given it another hour or so but we were both exhausted and just desperate to get in somewhere. 

TLDR: Room not ready 1.5 hours after check in time and desk staff not able to tell us when it would be. Seemingly no manager on site, and didn’t want to cancel the reservation for me. Ended up moving hotels."
hotels,"No Show Hey guys! I am a nightshifter in a hotel and i have come up wth a thought. Mainly for the felow front deskers, should a not notified no show have a way to ""punish"" per say the person? I face this situation sometimes, where people just don't show up and don't give us any information. I think it shoud exist a system where hotels could se how often the person has been doing no shows and if they wanted to accept the reservation anyway or, at least, leave it to second plan. Like if another reservation comes up and that is the last room of that type the often no show guy looses it. I know booking as something similar, but you can't know that kind of information. I just think people should be more considerate about the front deskers work. As for example, that can disturb the night auditors job a lot. Besides, hotels end up loosing money most of the times! I mean a system where you could say it was a no show and the person, when making reservations, would have that little note there, saying something around ""you have had x no shows, the hotel will decide if your reservation is accepted or placed as overbooking"" What do you think about this ?"

I confronted the front desk employees about it &amp; they denied it saying that they needed the consent of the guest to give that information out. I honestly think they lied to cover themselves.

This is the first time I've stayed at a hotel by myself; usually its with family, generally my mom, who's very assertive. So I've never had to deal with this kind of situation, and usually in these kinds of situations where the experience wasn't great, I just look on the bright side and move on, maybe let them know but make no demands or anything.

This though. This was insane.

The front desk lady was lovely, and I was able to get a reservation on short notice following some car trouble. Its not a classy, fancy hotel by any means, but the bed was so uncomfortable that I literally slept on the loveseat provided instead. 

I got virtually no sleep, and my attempt to sleep on the bed left me with some serious back pain. Not only that, but at 3:00 am I was woken up by a domestic in another room that was so loud and dramatic that in the moment, I thought it was someone watching TV too loudly. Until I heard police come and bang on their door. Didn't hear anything after that.

Diamond member with Hilton. 
Recently stayed over two weeks hotel hopping within the Hilton brand and at the end of the trip I only got about 50k points. Decided to look at a stay for a 1 nighter and the minimum for that location was 60k.  A bit pissed after thousands of dollars and couldn't even get a single weekday night in a mid sized city downtown.

So Im thinking of changing loyalty programs.
Only other hotels I tried was Marriott and ihg and best western and they seem pretty much the same. 

What would be the good program for obtaining more nights?
Of course I would like it to be a popular chain for safety/cleanliness and multiple locations.

 Ex. Hyatt has a good program but sadly around me there is 1 hotel in my city and surrounding cities might have 0-1. But Hilton has 3-4 per city.

As of this moment I'm leaning toward ihg. Multiple locations everywhere and I did research over a year ago and remember that after about a week stay you can accrue points to be worth 1 nights stay in any mid sized city."

Staying in a basic  hotel and you can't get into your favourite restaurant or a restaurant that is quite hard to get a booking, go to a 4/5 star hotel with a well known name with a concierge that has the golden keys and ask them to book it. If they ask for a room number just say it's a surprise for your friends/family and they don't want to know and they'll not ask for a room number or say you're going to the bar or wait in the reception.

hotels,"For Safety Reasons… Your room number should not be said out loud. Not by you. Not by the Front Desk. Any stranger could hear and before you know it, you’ve got a knock at your door at 2am. It’s best practice to treat your room number like your credit card number. 

Similarly, do not write your room number on your room key card. This is why the front desk gives you a key card cover. That small piece of plastic is so easy to lose (happens daily at my hotel). Plus, the writing doesn’t come off, so we can’t reuse the key (they’re pretty expensive 😬). If you lose your key on the street, you basically just gave a stranger access to you and your stuff. 

Hotel training (in my experience and study) tells the employee not to say the room number out loud to protect the guest. If you come to the desk with an issue with your room, they’re supposed to ask for your name and look up your room number in the computer. I get a lot of guests who give me their room number after I ask for their name and I cringe. We can only keep you safe if you help us."

hotels,"ADVICE PLZ: My motel housekeepers are now refusing to knock on motel doors TLDR: my housekeeping team is now refusing to knock on motel doors, they want the rooms to be confirmed vacant before they enter because the youngest (16) has walked in on naked people 3 times. 

&amp;#x200B;

Am I going crazy?

I run a 10-room motel in the mountains. My housekeeping team is a family, Mom and two daughters (ages 18 &amp; 16). 

Our checkout time is 10am, which is a little early by industry standards. Because of this, people aren't always out on time as they didn't realize our checkout time is 10 instead of the standard 11.

We are entirely contactless, much like an AirBnB, guests make reservations and their room numbers and key codes are texted to them the day of their arrival. They don't have to do anything to formally check in or out.  Since we are so small, we can usually tell who is in their rooms based on the cars in front. Everyone just parks in front of their rooms.

They have been working for me for about 8 months and over that time, the youngest daughter has walked in on naked people about 3 times. The mother is extremely mama-bear and the girls are very sheltered... I actually only ever hired one of the daughters and the mom took it on as like a whole-family job LOL which is great. One of those 3 times that the young daughter walked in on people, it turned into a big blow-out where I had to come down to the room and force them to leave because they were extremely disgruntled at realizing they didn't have an extra hour and being walked in on by a teenager during sexy time. The mom got down to the room before me and they actually slammed the door in her face, breaking our door.

The morning of New Years Eve, my assistant manager on duty arrived at check-out time to help the ladies start pulling bed sheets since we were full back-to-back. She just wanted to be helpful because she was new. The housekeeping team saw this act as my assistant manager arriving at check-out to make sure that everyone left on time so my housekeepers wouldn't be delayed.

Since this, the mom has approached me and said that I should be doing that every single day (not just busy days, I asked). She wants me to knock on all the doors and tell people it's time to leave, and they will enter once the guests are 100% gone.

She posits that it is my job to do that because they are housekeepers and should not be responsible for guest interactions. I told her that the girls need to KNOCK ON THE DOORS LOUDER AND ENTER SLOWLY if they think someone might still be there! I said it's certainly not their job to deal with disgruntled guests who are refusing to leave on time... but yeah, it is their job to knock on doors and go in when they are ready to start cleaning. I said if guests were mistaken about check-out time, the way that they know it's time to go is because housekeeping comes around to clean. It is too abrasive to have the manager going around evicting people at check out time, since I'm obviously not a housekeeper... it seems weird and jarring and uncomfortable for me to do that.

PLEASE tell me your thoughts on this, I feel like I'm taking crazy pills!!!!!

P.S. I have since purchased red door handle signs that say CHECKED OUT, which I will make clear as a new check-out protocol for guests... please hang the checked out door tag on your outside handle when you leave. Easy peasy. However, I'm sure some will forget or ignore that, what am I supposed to do about these housekeepers refusing to knock on doors now? We are a small town and it is REALLY hard to find good help.

Give me all your feedback!!!!"

I won't get charged until like early May when the pre-arrival deposit gets charged.

Now the anxious part of me is like ""damn, did I enter the incorrect card details?"" I can only see the expiration date which is right. I don't think I can view the card information.

In situations like this, would my reservation have gone through if it was incorrect? Like if I entered the wrong credit card number, would it verify that it is wrong and prevent me from booking? Or would any number work and it's just ""holding my info on file"" until the charge?"

But if the hotel is basically empty I don't see why someone can't check out at later.

I got here at 230.. said she didn’t know if room would be ready by check in at 3..
So I go back to my car and come back and check at 315.. they tell me that Priceline hasn’t paid them yet. So 2 hours later phone calls to and from something is wrong with the credit card machine that Priceline’s card is not going through. Priceline is blaming it on the the hotel and vice versa. Between the interactions I’m seeing while sitting here and the recent reviews I’m reading online, this place has dramatically gone downhill. It’s sad because at one point they were a decent 2 star hotel that I always boasted how polite  their  staff were.

Now they are hitting me with a $100 deposit .. which was NEVER the case prior. I lost my bank card and put this on my cash app card. So I don’t have the cash on me nor do I have a credit card. Nowhere on Priceline’s website or confirmation paperwork does it
Mention this, or on the website does it mention ANYWHERE. And now it’s too late to go to my bank to be able to get any money out.

What are my options ? The problem with their system and the credit card had nothing to do with me.  The service here is so sub par and if I were to ask for a refund it obviously would not be immediate and I would be stuck in the car in the freezing cold for the night. 

I’m literally appalled. 
Can they legally require me to put down for incidentals (I don’t smoke or anything) that’s even if I can get this credit card issue figured out ?"

LIKE LIST:

1st - Asians in general - Very nice costumers and very respectfull

2nd - Americans - i don't know why but i think americans are very enjoyable as a costumer if the stay goes well (if it doesn't we are dead)

3rd - eastern europe - a bit noisy in general but super good vibes and very autosuficient

4th - Spanish America - Super sweet people but haven't really checked them in a lot of times, so i can't make a full decision. 

5th- NETHERLANDS - These guys could be in the top of the list easly, very understandable people, very respectfull as well.

DISLIKE LIST:

4th - english people - not that they are bad, they are just very silent or introverted and meh. Don't really talk about their stay

3rd - french people - You just don't like to make it easy for us 🥲

2nd - Brasilians - You're just annoying in a lot of situations, the opposite of eastern europe actually

1st - Portuguese - I'm portuguese myself, and i can't stand people from my own country. We are so fucking annoying, everything is a problem and similar to brazillians actually. The worst case was definitly with a portuguese who tried to not pay the stay. Long story. 

Give here your lists and please don't take this as hate, i  have liked costumers from everywhere! These are just the nations  that have caused problems through out time. Only france is the country i can't find one soul i like, sorry."

Upon check out we were charged $250 cleaning fee because the room was “heavily smoked in”.  The problem is that neither one of us smokes.  We reached out to customer service and were deferred to the hotel directly; however, when we reached out to the hotel, front desk was rude and refused to transfer us to the manager.  We emailed the manager and never received any response.  We are now trying to escalate this issue to corporate and having a hard time finding the contact info for the leadership team of Choice Hotels.  The fact that the hotel refuses to cooperate tells me that they have no evidence of us smoking in the room, and we can submit medical records to prove that we don’t smoke.  What the hotel did is wrong and one can argue that it is theft.  If anyone happens to know the contact info for the Choice Hotels leadership team, can you please share with us?  If anyone or someone you know has experienced the same issue, please also share your approach.  

We also tried disputing the charges with our credit card company, Wells Fargo, but were unsuccessful.  They refused to hear our case and kept deferring us to the hotel directly.

hotels,"How do I deal with a post-pay reservation for early check out? I’m staying at the Hilton in Prague and it’s an absolute dumpster fire. The service is almost non-existent, the food has been nearly inedible (breakfast was ok), and it constantly sounds like someone is stomping around in the hallways. There’s a fee for everything and nothing has met expectations for the price point in this city. We were set to stay here 10 days and want to check out after 3. 

I tried to call the front desk to tell them I wanted to check out tomorrow, but no answer. After several tries, I went to talk to them in person and was told I had to contact the agent that booked the reservation (AMEX). I called AMEX and was told that we could check out, but the property stated that I would be charged the full 10 day amount plus incidentals. I went through the AMEX TOS and the only thing shown about cancellations is this bit:
&gt;There is no charge for cancellations made before 23:59 (property local time) on January 2, 2023. Cancellations or changes made after 23:59 (property local time) on January 2, 2023 or no-shows are subject to a property fee equal to the first nights rate plus taxes and fees.

hotels,"21+ Hotel Predicament I was wondering if anybody had any ideas of what to do in this situation. 

I booked a hotel for myself and another person to stay in. Both of us are under 21, and we did not know this when we booked the hotel. We would like to keep this reservation because its price, location, and accomodations are fantastic. 

I called the hotel to see if we could pre-pay the cost, and have them clear the mini bar prior to our stay, to which they said no. They did ask for my name so they could see my reservation. 

We plan on using a fake ID to check in.

 Since they have my name and know that both myself and the other person are under 21, should I cancel the reservation and put it under the other person's name and another email and when we check in use their fake ID?

Other than 'cancel your reservation and find a different hotel', what input to people have?"

hotels,"Not charged for my stay at a hotel. Odd situation. I’ve seen a lot of posts in my search for answers talking about payment holds and pre-authorizations that occur when a hotel is to charge you for your stay. This is not the case with my strange situation. 

It was the day before New Years, and we checked in to a busy hotel. The lady at the front desk seemed flustered and took a moment to pull up our reservation. She found it, but had some trouble with rooms not being available yet as they were being shown in her system as not having been cleaned yet.

We stood there for several minutes while she worked on her computer and went back and forth between the manager’s office. She didn’t really communicate with us what was going on at all. 

When she first viewed the reservation, she asked if we had somehow already checked in? We had not. She also asked if the card on the reservation for payment was a card ending in ****, numbers I did not even recognize. I had booked through Hotels.com, and confirmed in the app that I only had one card on file for payment…my main card that DID NOT end in the numbers she read off. 

I told her that, no - that was not my card number. She just said “huh,” and went back to trying to figure out whatever was going on with her system. 

She did not take my card for a deposit, which I found to be very odd especially since it was a party holiday. 

She did not even ask to see my debit card for payment AT ALL. 

Moments later, she handed us our room keys and had us sign a form to indicate the names of any guests that would be coming to our room, and that was it. 

We stayed for 2 nights, and no charges from the hotel appeared on my statement. No holds, nothing pending. 

We checked out this morning, and still - nothing. What should I do? This is very odd."

hotels,"A Review of the Taj Rishikesh Resort &amp; Spa, Uttarakhand, India  The resort is located about 20 miles from Rishikesh town. It is spread over 12 acres of gardens, with the Ganges flowing just below the resort. The hotel is constructed in the rustic chalet-type architecture prevalent in the local Garhwal region, with sloping roofs, tiri stone dressing, and wooden eaves blending seamlessly with the breathtaking natural scenery.

The hotel has 79 rooms ranging from standard rooms to individual villas, overlooking the river Ganges and nested within the Shivalik mountain range. We chose a deluxe room with floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding doors that opened onto a little balcony offering a stunning view of the Ganges River with mesmerizing sunsets and sunrises through the thick canopy of the surrounding Singthali forest.

I figure that one affordable way to do that would be to get a hotel suite that has a large dining/conference table within the room. That way I could cover my need for 1 hotel room for the one out of town team member and my need for a group conference table with one expense line (figuring that it would likely be cheaper to pay for a hotel suite than to pay for a hotel room + a conference room).

But I can't seem to find a way to search for a hotel room that includes a large table.

We had no power overnight, no heating, no hot water. Hotel staff were not too forthcoming with information, and only provided an extra blanket for the night.

They did offer to pay to put us in a nearby hotel if we could find one, but we couldn’t find any other local accommodation.

Wifi was also out for 3 days (23rd, 24th &amp; 25th December) so I was unable to reach any family for the holidays. No alternative to wifi was offered, and no cell service.

I’m wondering if it’s worth me seeking any kind of refund here? Obviously the hotel is not at fault for losing power, but I do feel they weren’t at all prepared for it. No generator, or ways to keep rooms warm etc, which led to a very cold and uncomfortable Christmas.

I know what you deal with and I do everything that I can to make your job easier. My room is spotless when I leave. If I am there long enough and get to know you, I will even ask if you need anything when I go out to run errands. You make my home away from home a little more enjoyable. I want to hug every one of you when my time in your hotel is finished and I move on to the next project in another city.

With that being said, what’s up with all of the garbage that people are leaving in the hallways? Can’t we make a rule against this? You ask them to return luggage carts. Can’t you ask them to dispose of their trash in an appropriate trash receptacle?

And to my fellow hotel patrons, does this bother you as much as it does me? Am I being a Karen here?

hotels,"Room with views debacle Alright i have to ask how everyone handles this. I'm a front desk manager. My hotel is 4 stars but it doesn't sell view on your room (it's on the fine print of the reservation email). You pay for a room (either standard or superior suite). Most of my guest are groups of 30 people (mostly old people) that buy guided group tours to travel the Patagonia with a TC. 

The things is that EVERYTIME a new group arrives they complain that they paid the same as everyone so they should get a room with a view like some of the other group guests. Usually if i have a room free i just used to change them to that room but i found that they usually just run to the other guests in the group to tell them that ""if you complain they WILL change you"" so i end up with 5 elderly marriages telling me to gie them the same treatment so i stopped doing that. 

I also have travel agencies that promise the guests that they will have views and then i end up with people cursing at me and then when i tell them that the travel agency lied to them i have calls from said agencies imploring me to change their rooms for a fee (that we don't have since we don't sell view)

1. It'll be a Four Seasons.  S1 and S2 were at Four Season properties, and I think it has been beneficial for both parties, at least to the extent of continuing the relationship.

2.  Full Rentout.  At least for S2, production rented out the entire property in the offseason (I think 3 months).  So there needs to be a low season.

3.  On the water.  If we keep with the theme, it will need to be a beachfront property. 

4.  Asia.  Mike White has indicated that it will take place in Asia.  “I think the third season would be maybe a satirical and funny look at death and Eastern religion and spirituality.""

5.  Offseason can't be too rainy.  Rain is a terror on production. So no monsoon season stays.

6.  Covered communal buildings.  It can't be a bunch of standalone villas / beach huts / etc by themselves.  There needs to be an indoor space of significant size for hours that can't be shot outside, restaurant shots, etc.

7.  Politics.  Not sure if the Chinese properties would be great to film at.

So if those assumptions are true, then:
a. The Maldive / Bora Bora properties are out.  Too expensive, too distributed, not practical.

b.  No inland properties.  This excludes a bunch.

c. No city properties (Seoul, Tokyo, etc).

We are left with:

Bali - Jimaran Bay https://www.fourseasons.com/jimbaranbay/

Malaysia - Langkawi https://www.fourseasons.com/kohsamui/

Thailand - Koh Samui https://www.fourseasons.com/kohsamui/

Vietnam - Hoi An https://www.fourseasons.com/hoian/

If it *is* at one of these four, my guess is the Hoi An.  Each setting in S1/S2 has had some theme of local history/culture, and the guest's interaction with it (for better or for worse).  I think the Hoi An's location near Da Nang makes for a Vietnam vet thread pretty easy.

To my surprise, there was an inch+ of water from that point all the way to the walls where the urinals were. (It made a splash when I landed)

I don't want to put out my friends or family and have them host a party in their homes, and everything that goes along with that. 

Do people ever rent conference rooms in hotels just for get togethers? Such as, ordering pizza to the rented room and hotel, providing my own food for my party, and asking for some chairs and tables for the people attending?

I am trying to find my own info about this, but I'm not sure if this is common or cost effective with the cost of renting conference rooms by the hour.

hotels,"Is it inappropriate to leave food for housekeeping when staying at a hotel?  I would actually prefer housekeeping's opinion on this. I had to stay in a suite last week out of town for a surgery. I was there for about four days. The suite had a full kitchen so I bought groceries in order to minimize my exposure to the elements. However, I was so anxious about the procedure that I hardly ate what I bought and in the end was left with a large Macy's bag full of unopened staple groceries: canned tuna, bread, breakfast bars, cereal, fruit, condoments, etc. Before I left for the airport, I decided I'd give the homeless population the remainder of my provisions, but after doing so, it occurred to me that housekeeping is also very impoverished, and unlike many of the homeless, they don't have severe mental health issues/drug problems, and I felt like they'd be a bit more deserving for the helping hand. But as I was on the airplane, I wondered if they'd take it if I left it? I just don't want to see the food go to waste: on the one hand, I am not sure the homeless would appreciate the staple food due to their condition and might ignore it altogether, on the other hand, would housekeeping feel it unethical to take the food or would they even be grossed out at the idea that it was bought for someone else's consumption? Like I said, it was simply bought at the store and never opened, it just sat in a grocery bag for a few days, no different than a shelf at Walmart, but I'd hate for them to just think I was a lazy tenant that didn't clean up after himself and then they just throw it away when it was my intention that they should have it.

hotels,"How should I behave when I am convinced I am charged a fraudulent fee? I don't need legal advice and I don't want to waste everybody's time, so I will keep things short:

- I have booked through booking.com a room in Chile for around 203 USD.  
-I have gotten a confirmation that my final rate is 203 USD. The fine print says, that a 19% VAT may apply on addition to this rate.
-Foreign tourists in Chile who pay in a foreign currency are exempt from VAT, which is called IVA here. This is a very well-known fact and this was also EXPLICITLY stated at the hotel that I am staying at.
-The bill that I am presented has a comission of 17% extra on it. On the bill, it doesn't even say it's a tax, but just a comission to booking.com. I have never agreed to such a comission. My confirmation clearly shows a final price of 203 USD.
-I took this up with the very useless booking.com support but they keep insisting that the tax is mandatory. First of all, for some reason they charged 17% instead of the potential 19% tax, and secondly this is not even listed on my bill as a tax, but a comission. This is, if you completely ignore that by the laws of Chile, I don't even have to pay any VAT in hotels.

In absolutely any case, I refuse to pay this fraudulent extra charge, which I am completely unable to claim in my tax report, as it is clearly labelled as a comission. Both booking.com and the hotel are very unhelpful. 

I am still at the hotel and will leave soon. How should I deal with this situation? I will offer them to pay my agreed rate of 203 USD. Should I just leave if they refuse this option? 

I am afraid, that if I just pay this fraudulent extra charge once I check out, that I will have no legal claim anymore to ask for my money back, as with that, 'I have agreed to the price'. What can I do?

Never going to use this garbage site ever again, that's for sure."

hotels,"Is this a reasonable response? Over in another sub, someone is saying that a guest at the hotel they work at committed suicide by jumping from the top of an atrium and landing in the lobby. No one else was injured. I'm guessing the hotel has a few hundred rooms.

People are saying that the GM should have shut the entire hotel down, kicked everyone who was staying out and cancelled all incoming reservations for several days, and that this would be a very reasonable response.

Now, it's been 10+ years since I last worked in hotels so maybe things have changed. But, would this be a reasonable response? 

Because I am thinking if a guest has a reservation at your hotel and you decide to not honor it that you would have to find that guest equal accommodations, and you would need to pay their room and tax, equal to the number of nights they were staying with you. Initially I was thinking the hotel would only have to pay the first night, but then I thought, if they were paying $250 a night at your hotel, but the only other thing available at a comparable hotel was a room for $750 a night and they were staying 3 nights should the guest be responsible for that extra  $1500?

And if I recall it's not exactly easy to kick a paying guest out, unless they are involved in illegal activity, or there is some public health emergency, or the hotel has become uninhabitable.

If you were a guest at that hotel and you were found out someone committed suicide would you think it reasonable of the hotel to kick you out?"

hotels,"Hotel asking us to switch rooms mid reservation We booked a trip Dec 13-20, and booked 3 hotel rooms on booking.com for those dates. Today I received an invoice from the hotel directly, and noticed that all 3 rooms were itemized Dec 13-17 as one rate, and Dec 17-20 as a second rate, but the total matched booking.com’s original total.

I’d never seen this type of breakdown before, so I emailed the hotel and they said that there’s a possibility we’d need to switch rooms in the middle of our reservation. I’ve never experienced this, and think it’s completely unreasonable. We are travelling with 2 families including 4 kids and 2 seniors, and staying at an apartment style hotel as we need kitchens. I think it will be a huge pain to move in the middle of our trip.

Has anyone else experienced this? What’s the best way to ensure we don’t have to switch rooms?"

This is an old-ish story but it still bothered me. My family shared a room at a hotel once and me being a light sleeper, woke up to the door opening. We didn't bolt the door that night and some dude walked in and from his backpack I assumed he's a guest. What must have surprised him first was there's a card already in the electricity thingy (the whole thing happening in the dark). He saw me sitting up and apologized and left, I was half awake and can't think of anything to say.

My dad woke up and asked me what happened, I told him and he told me to go back to sleep. I heard him left before going back to sleep. In the morning I asked him out of curiosity and he said the hotel denied anything happened.

The rest of it is blurry memory at best. But is there something that should have happened back then? I know double booking is possible but is there something else? Again this is mostly just me letting it go from memory."

Last  night i was in the front desk (11:20PM), when a female guest (50yo)  entered running and crying and got into the aisle (don't know where she  went after), then her husband entered and said to me ""Good night, i need  you to call the police look at what my wife did, she drank a lot and  she's completely insane now""

The  man his face covered in blood from a 4 finder scratch in his cheek. I  did not understand at first (i was quite tired and in the end of my  shift, i clock out at midnight) and thought it was an accident. The  husband then said ""i don't know where she is please help me"", I went to  our CCTV room and found her curled up and crying in the carpet of the  first floor (where her room was), The hudband then says ""please don't  call the cops, she sometimes gets like this, let me talk to her"", i went  with him (was not going to let him be alone with her in that state for  both of them sake) and when we arrived, she was gone.

We  heard crying from their room and he told he didn't have the cardkeys  because they were in her purse. I went down and made a new copy for him  (WAS NOT GOING TO USE MY MASTER KEY), when he got in, he shut the door  quickly and i stayed in hall to make sure there wasn't going to be a  serious crime or something (didn't know what to do), The shouting didn't  stop (the woman was insulting him and crying and the husband tried to  calm her down unsucessfully. The my Houseman radioed me to tell me guest  were calling about the disturbances. So i had to put a an end to this. I  knocked on the door and told them that if this didn't end now, i would  have to call the police right now. The husband told me to wait 5  minutes. And the disturbance didn't end so i had to knock again. When  the husband opened the door the woman sprinted by him and tripped on the  floor. When she got up, her dress was down (full view of everything)  and she clinged to my leg and shouted ""PLEASE GET ME OUT OF HERE"" so i  had to tell the husband to stay in his room while i escorted her to the  lobby, he told me ""YOU DON'T UNDERSATND I HAVENT DONE ANYTHING"" and i  replied ""i understand sir but.."" and i was cut off by the woman getting  angry and me and shouting ""YOU UNDERSTAND HIM? YOU ARE ALL THE SAME SON  OF BITCHES, IM GET YOU ALL IN JAIL FOR THIS""

Then  she calmed down on his own (was still on the floor), got her up... and  bring her down to the lobby. Called the police (they arrived in 5  minutes) and after taking her statement and the guys statement they  decided to arrest him.

I spent until 3AM on the police station giving my statement.

Today  i come to work to find out the woman left the city early by plane. At  about 8PM i received a message from this woman telling me that she  hasn't heard from her husband and the family was worried. To call her if  i knew something because his cellphone was off.

The  man's cellphone was found by housekeeping since the room was vacated  (they had checkout tomorrow but the hotel made man persona non-grata and  banned him, i was instructed to just give him his stuff.

The man is still missing and i have his stuff.

Did  i do right? I have a month experience and DIDNT know how to handle  things, I let my manager know what happened before giving my statement  just in case and she said go ahead."

hotels,"Doing research for my capstone project -- need help + willing interviewees Hello Reddit! 

I am taking my capstone class for my M.S. Hospitality and Tourism Management at the University of Southern California and I need to conduct some research in order to write the paper that is due at the end of the course. 

**To give you background on the project:** I am looking at ways in which small hotel chains (10 or fewer hotel properties) purchase and manage IT software in addition to their sustainability program + their approach to marketing/branding. I hope to find a solution that allows me to package software and other needed programs to make it not only financially efficient, but will allow the hotel owner to focus on their customer and the service that they provide. 

**Question 1:** For this week I need help identifying the various channels that are used to pick the software you're wanting to purchase for your hotel (specific websites, word of mouth, an obscure database?). If you really had the time and wanted to pick a software and walk me through your decision making process that would be very helpful (via phone (need to setup in the next day or so) or in a comment works). 

**Question 2:** My second ask (and feel free to do this privately if you want) I need to know how to price my service, but without every purchasing these systems I am at a loss. If you've bought one of the following systems and could give me the ballpark price you paid (whether in months or per year) that would be the best! Specifically I am looking to price out these systems: Metasearch, OTA, GDS, Hotel's Booking Platform for Website, Central Reservation Mgmt (CRS), and/or your overall PMS. 

**Have time to be interviewed?** Eventually I will need to talk to those who work at a hotel property with 10 or fewer hotels, preferably someone in management, if that's you and would be up for a casual conversation in the next few weeks I would greatly appreciate you time. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any and all feedback is appreciated! I will come back next week for round two!"

hotels,"When you don't get the room you booked online This has happened to me only once, luckily. But reading reviews, it seems to happen quite often. 

In my case, it was a guest house in Vietnam, which had a lot of glowing reviews. I ordered, on Agoda, a 40m2 room with a balcony. What I ended with was 15m2 room, with a tiny window. It wasn't what I ordered, and I said so to the lady at guesthouse. She just replied, flatly, that this was the only room available, and that was that. So I used their wifi to search for a better hotel deal. I found one. I then grabbed my bagqs and checked out. 

As I did so, the lady at the counter seemed a bit alarmed, as I had booked for four days. She dawdled before giving my passport back, while she tried to talk me out of it. 

The booking conditions stipulated that any cancellation within 3 days of the booking date would incur the first night's charge. I was semi-happy to let them have that US$12,  as next to thousands I would spend on that holiday, it wasn't worth wasting time and energy on. Plus, I'd used the ensuite to have a badly needed shower and shave. I figured I owed them a little bit for the shower, and the luggage storage while I went out for a meal, and went to check out a few rival hotel rooms. 

But in an alternative reality, if I had immediately cancelled the booking upon seeing the room,  would I have automatically been entitled to a full refund, given that it wasn't what I ordered? Or do hoteliers have some way of wriggling out of that? ( I suspect that, because it seems to happen a lot, going by what I've read)."

hotels,"Differences between 5 star hotels in asia vs usa I know it is a big generalization but my experiences with hotels in asia is that their continental breakfast is not really ""continental"" when they offer dumplings and fried rice and the rooms smell different and water pressure is higher in the ones in the states. Hotels in asia are typically more modern with newer buildings."

Because of some plan changes i called to cancel the first night and just stay the second night. The rep told me the room type I had reserved was no long available and the only room that was available was $250/night....how is this possible? I'm not changing my dates, I'm just dropping one of the nights. The new total is $35 less than the original. 

Is this common practice? I'm just trying to understand a) why he's saying there's no rooms of the same type available, when I already have reserved that room and b) why they're just not canceling the first night, but trying to rebook my second night at a higher rate"

Rather than hoping for a refund, do you think any hotel would allow me to check out early and then use the 2 extra nights a few weeks later when I'm back in the same city??? Or is that a stupid 'no' question?!

hotels,"Checking into a hotel with a different name on the card? Hi Reddit, not sure if I’m in the right sub for this. But recently I booked a trip with my boyfriend to Las Vegas for my 21st birthday. Just recently I was doing a recheck of the price since the date I’m going is so soon, and I realize the hotel policy is check in with an age minimum of 21. I’m literally checking in the day before my birthday, at the Luxor,  My boyfriend is already 21 so my initial thought is to have him check in, but can he use my card to check in or will that be an issue? I already changed the hotel info so the name the room is under is his name, but will the hotel really press about the card having a different name?"

hotels,"Hotel is stealing from me Hey guys,

 I’m having a bit of an issue with a hotel that I booked on hotels.com and am wondering if you guys have any tips on how to deal with it.

 It turned out it wasn’t really a hotel, but was an airBnB that somehow got listed on hotels.com and after the stay which was wholly unacceptable (but that’s another story) the “owner” (I think) decided to charge me basically twice what I already paid because he thinks there was extra people in the suite.

 The room was $530 for 4 nights and he is saying since there was two extra people in the room the price jumps to $970 for 4 nights. 

 There wasn’t any extra people in the room. When we “checked” in some people on the same flight as us dropped some bags in our suite because we were closer to to the venue and then went to their hotel. 

 I told him this, but he didn’t care.

 I was completely unaware that he was intending to charge us an extra $441 dollars until after the stay. We could’ve easily rectified it if he had asked at the time. 

 Even with that said, there was nothing anywhere that said there would be extra charges for an additional person. The guy “checking” us in never said a thing about it. Never asked how many people were staying nothing like that.

 He is proving completely unreasonable to deal with and is just holding my $2000 damage deposit ransom saying I owe him money.

 Hotels.com can’t, or won’t do anything about it.

 I’m in the process of issuing a dispute but my credit card says that I can’t file a dispute on the $2000 damage deposit until 15 days after he rang it throughZ

 I’ve contacted the Greater Toronto Hotel Association to advise them and get their advice but I haven’t heard back.

 Do you guys have any advice other than to dispute the transaction?"

hotels,"Tips for non-smokers staying in a smoking room? Hello Reddit!  My husband and I are non-smokers, and we will be staying in a hotel smoking room in March.  


First, I'll say:  We've been to this hotel before.  Each of their rooms are unique, offer many in-suite amenities, and we are excited about the particular room will we be staying in.


The hotel does offer an air purifier, and we have reserved it.  In the past, this has done a good job of removing the immediate smell, but it does tend to linger in the sheets and on the bedspread.  


Last time we stayed here, we had a bit of difficulty sleeping comfortably because of the smoke smell.  Not a complaint.  Just a fact.


Are there any tips you could offer to help us make ourselves more comfortable?  Should we try bringing our own bedding?  Maybe some Febreeze?  Any suggestions you have would be much appreciated.


Thanks in advance!"

I'd like to listen to what hotel brand you guys chose to accrue points with and why (Different rewards programs, terms and conditions, customer experiences, already established accounts by family members etc)

I've been wanting to start accruing points and I have had a Hilton Honors account for a while. I just haven't really been travelling a lot in the recent years. I think that it would be a good idea to stick with one hotel brand to accrue points and save over the long run."

We were staying at some hotel my mother found on the internet. We got to the rooms and the first thing we noticed when we walked in was that the place smells of cigarette smoke. We call the lobby but they claim that they just cleaned it. Then, we see some sketchy loiterers walking around and call the lobby again. They get kicked out and we tried to go back to sleep. Suddenly, we hear some woman screaming and we look out the peephole just in time to see a man chasing a woman through the hallway, the woman screaming for help all the while. We called the cops and the office, then I make a move to go outside to see if she needs help but my mother barricades the door and refuses to let me go. The police arrive eventually and as he's being dragged away, we could hear him saying  "" Please don't let them take me away! I love you, I could never hurt you!"" 


The next morning, we filed a complaint. We got a coupon for our next visit. Yeah right. as if we'd ever stay there again.

hotels,"Homewood Suites &amp; Petty theft I just got back from a week long stay at Homewood Suites in Henderson, NV. I unpacked my iPhone charger, and plugged my phone into the wall. After a while my phone started to get unresponsive, and after rebooting and restarting, it just got worse and worse. Until I had the smart idea to unplug it from the charger. Thats when I noticed it wasn't my original apple charger that I brought with me, but some cheap Chinese knockoff.

So now I'm concerned.

Did this charger damage my phone?

Could this charger possibly be trying to get access to my phone? (Probably unlikely)

We're other things taken?


I'm a travel for work, its all I do. I carry thousands of dollars of tools, and thousands in personal items. I have lost trust in this Hilton chain and I will be calling in the morning to complain.

hotels,"Best Western of Rice Lake, WI gave me the shaft. On 8/12/17 after a long day at work, I went to the Best Western in Rice Lake, WI to check into a room and relax. I had made my reservation with the hotel directly a week before I arrived. I assumed my reservation credit card would hold my room. I was dead wrong. I was greeted by an older woman with neatly styled white hair, professionally dressed. This woman proceeded to stop and look at my dirty appearance for an extended time as the words slowly came out of her mouth, ""Can I help you?"". After she was done scanning my appearance, I told her that I had a reservation and would like to check in. She gave a surprised look, said ""ok"" and paused before asking for my name and began to type. As she typed a look of concern overcame her face as she said I can't find the reservation under that name. I then told her that I have the reservation number in an Email and I will go get my phone. This was at 4:00. When I came back in, the woman was checking in guests to another room. After a reasonably short wait, I began to give her my reservation number from the Check-in email I had received earlier that morning. (I also had an email from the day the reservation was made directly with the hotels front desk.) She then typed it in and still insisted that she couldn't find the reservation and said ""let me find out what's going on"". As I waited patiently, she began to type into her computer. She then looked up and told me that my reservation had been entered wrong in the computer and it showed that my check in date was 9/12/2017. I then began to ask how that could be, given that I have two emails with the correct date, one I had received just earlier that day. She confessed that she didn't know and when asked for a different roo. she said she was booked up. I then began to leave and told her I don't want my card charged for a reservation I cannot use. She said that she would take care of it and wouldn't let that happen... 
I after finding a new room in a booked town, I went to my room and began to call and explain the situation to Best Western customer service. As I am a Diamond Member, my representative took my concerns to heart and began to investigate. Her findings shocked and amazed me. The front desk woman I had just been dealing with changed my reservation as I stood in front of her and lied to my face about it. Customer service had shown that my reservation was changed to a lower rate at 4pm and then again at 4:03 it was changed from 8/12 to 9/12. Customer service was just as shocked and upset as I was. This wonderful woman began to get more information about the time I spent at the front desk trying to check in and began to create a report to send to Best Western corporate management as well as the general manager of the hotel at Rice Lake, WI. Now, I work for the railroad, we get dirty. 8/12 was a day where I didn't get very dirty and entered the hotel still wearing my safety vest. Even if I was too dirty for the woman at the hotel, I shouldn't have been the subject of Preconceptions. I have spent enough money with Best Western To get to my diamond status. I should be able to make a reservation with priority and not have to search for another hotel in a town that is mostly booked up as it is summer time in a small fishing town next to a lake. I have received reasonable compensation for this matter, so I write this just to inform of the practices of the staff of the Best Western of Rice Lake. The Best Western file number from my report is 170812-2716 for verification. No one should be treated this way. "

I would like to hear from you fellow travelers about your opinions about hotel loyalty. What makes you go back to a hotel, aka, makes you loyal to one particular hotel? What is the most important thing you look for in a hotel, when booking for a stay? What are some of the current pain points with the hotel experience as it is? What makes you choose something like airbnb over hotel besides the price? I would really appreciate your constructive responses. Thank you!"
hotels,"Stayed at InterContinental Bangkok, and totally loved it! Very rarely do I go out of my way to talk about how awesome a particular hotel is, and this is one of those times. The service was impeccable and the people at the restaurants went out of their way to ensure that we had no problems eating. What's strange abouth that? We are hardcore vegetarians, and to top that, no eggplant and no mushrooms either. This basically means almost anything/everything is out of question in Thai food.

&gt;After decades in the dark, the regal entrance and corridors of the former NOPSI headquarters in the CBD are again open to the public -- this time as the new more than $50 million NOPSI Hotel. A stately, 1920's era building, the NOPSI Hotel had laid dormant and boarded up for more than 30 years. On July 6, however, the hotel opened polished and re-engineered for new use. The hotel's name, and much of its decor, is an homage to New Orleans Public Service Inc., the company that once provided electricity and gas in the city and operated its streetcars and buses. 

I plan on visiting New Orleans this summer and going to check this place out. Just wanted to share!"

hotels,"These Big Website Mistakes Are Costing You Leads and Bookings HOW (AND WHY) TO HUMANIZE YOUR ONLINE PRESENCE
To boost property awareness and connect with new travelers who have never stayed with you before, you need to have an online presence — in many cases a website. To get people to actually book reservations with you though, simply having a place for online visitors to land isn’t enough. In order to successfully convince people to choose your property over others, your website has to be built, updated, and managed with conversion in mind.

So what makes website visitors convert, and what makes them leave for another option? I’ve written plenty of blog posts that focus on the former (i.e. what to do right on your website), but not as many focus on the latter.

In this post, I’d like to dive into what prevents travelers from booking online reservations by highlighting 6 common mistakes I see managers make when it comes to their websites:

Mistake #1: Not Helping Visitors Understand What Makes Your Resort Different

One of the biggest mistakes you can make when building your website is to neglect including content that helps visitors understand what makes your property different.

Most marketing managers have figured out what you already know, which is that you need a website to attract new visitors and drive more bookings. But not as many understand how to effectively use their website as a tool to differentiate from other local competitors. As a result, a lot of resort websites end up looking the same to travelers.

This can be a big problem when it comes to being able to successfully convince people to book reservations through your website. If your website looks like all the other websites in your geographic area, what would make someone ultimately pick yours over the rest?

To help your website visitors recognize what makes you different or unique, focus on implementing the following tips:

Put your biggest selling points front and center. Spend some time thinking about your biggest value propositions. Ask yourself questions such as, what is it that makes your property unique? Why do people stay at your property over others? What do you have that other local competitors don’t? Once you have your answers, incorporate these selling points into your homepage headings, copy, and feature photos. Be as specific as possible so that guests can quickly identify within a few seconds of landing on your website what makes your resort special.
Avoid using stock photography. If you haven’t already, hire a photographer and some models to take high-quality photos of your property that you can use on your website. Avoid using stereotypical stock photos and close-up shots of people smiling, relaxing, or eating food. Travelers want to see your property for what it is. Genuine photos that humanize your experience can help build trust and keep them from leaving your website in search of a property that offers more authenticity.
Make an actual list for visitors to go through. Create a section on your homepage or create an entirely separate page on your website that helps visitors easily understand what makes you different. Incorporate photos, testimonials from guests, bulleted lists, and other blurbs that make it easy for people to recognize the unique aspects and perks that you have to offer.
Let your past guests do the talking for you. Include videos, photos, and written testimonials from past guests that help you illustrate the main selling points of your property. For example, if you consider yourself the perfect place for families to stay, find a review from a guest that focuses on the experience they had as a family. If you offer specific amenities that help you differentiate from competitors, find a review from a guest that highlights those amenities for you.
Remember: Your goal isn’t to build a website that looks good (or one that looks as good as other properties in your area). Your primary goal is to build a website that drives conversions.

Mistake #2: Too Many Conflicting CTAs

Another big mistake that I see on a lot of websites is too many competing call-to-action statements, links, and buttons on the homepage.

When building or updating a website, the best thing you can do is keep things as simple and easy for visitors as possible. You want to provide visitors with the information they need to evaluate your property and decide if it’s right for them, but your ultimate goal is to drive them toward the booking section of your website as fast as possible.

Here are some ways to drive that desired action from your website visitors in less time:

Place one primary CTA button in the navigation section of your website. To make your reservation call-to-action incredibly clear and easy to find, place a button within the navigation menu that shows up on all pages.
Choose your website and graphic colors wisely. Keep the colors on your homepage relatively simple—don’t use more than 2-3 colors. Stay consistent with the rest of your branding. Use a bright, distinguishable color for the CTA button you place in the navigation area of your website.
Be consistent with your CTA messaging. Use similar words and phrases when directing people to your reservations section. Make it easy for visitors to understand what they need to do and where they need to go to check availability and book a stay.
Keep your homepage simple. Don’t go overboard with your homepage. Keep it clean and uncluttered. Doing so will help with load times, and ensure that your site can successfully load across any device.
Remember: Your job is to make it easy for your website visitors to understand how to take action.

Mistake #3: Low-Quality Photos &amp; Graphics

Using low-quality photos and graphics is another mistake I see property managers making on their websites. Because you’re using your website as a tool to interact with people who have never visited before, it’s important to start building trust with them from the second they land on your website for the first time.

Using high-quality photos and professional graphics can go a long way in helping visitors overcome any objections or hesitations they might have about booking a stay with you.

Travelers want to feel confident that they’re booking reservations at a professional, clean property. To drive them toward taking action, implement these tips:

Hire professionals. If you don’t already have them on your team, hire professional photographers and graphic designers to help you create high-quality content for your website.
Stay consistent with your visuals. Make sure that the images and graphics you’re placing on your website align with the actual look and feel of your property. Don’t unintentionally create the wrong expectations by using photos that don’t accurately represent your brand.
Test different types of media. Use video, interactive tours, and slideshows on your website to show website visitors what they can expect when they stay with you.
Remember: The key is to use visuals to tell stories, build trust, and leave nothing to the imagination.

Mistake #4: Your Website Isn’t Mobile-Friendly

These days, you can’t have a website that doesn’t load on all types of devices—computers, laptops, smartphones, and tablets. If your website isn’t mobile-friendly, you’re losing out on awareness, traffic, and online reservations.

Consider these statistics on the growing usage of smart devices and the internet in the U.S.:

77% of all Americans now own a smartphone—that number was just 35% in 2011.
Nearly eight-in-ten U.S. adults now own desktop or laptop computers, while roughly half now own tablet computers and around one-in-five own e-reader devices.
Overall, 73% of Americans go online on a daily basis. Along with the 21% who go online almost constantly, 42% go online several times a day and 10% go online about once a day.
65% of same day hotel reservations are made from a smartphone.
168M travel bookings are made on the internet each year.
To find out if your website is mobile-friendly, use this tool from Google. It will analyze your website and identify any issues that need to be addressed and fixed in order for online users to access your website from their smartphones or tablet devices.

Need help building a website that loads correctly on mobile devices? We can help.

Mistake #5: Not Keeping Information Up-to-Date

Keeping inaccurate or out-of-date information on your website is another costly mistake that can impact conversions. When you don’t take the time to keep information up-to-date, it’s much harder to gain the trust of the people who are trying to decide whether or not to book a stay.

To build trust and persuade visitors to book an online reservation through your website, make sure the following is up-to-date:

Contact information. Make sure you’re displaying the right phone number and email addresses.
Links. Make sure all the hyperlinks on your website send visitors to pages that still load. Eliminate any dead links.
Photos. Change or update photos depending on the season or any changes that may have recently been made at your property.
Blog Posts. Don’t let your blog go stale on your website. Show visitors that you’re still actively providing relevant information and that you’re still willing to engage with them.
Weather and directions. Keep interactive weather and map widgets intact on your website. Check periodically to make sure they don’t break or need to be updated.
Remember: Again, the key is trust. Showing online visitors that you’re actively involved in maintaining your online presence will help reassure them that you’re also probably actively involved in maintaining and updating your property itself.

Mistake #6: Not Leveraging Yourself as a Resource

The final mistake that can impact your ability to drive online reservations is not leveraging yourself as a resource. These days, travelers aren’t just looking for rooms to stay in. They want experiences, and they want to work with properties that can provide them with those experiences.

Leveraging yourself, your team, and your property as a resource can help you boost awareness, build trust, differentiate from competition, and drive more bookings.

To start positioning your resort as a resource for travelers, follow these steps:

Step 1: Launch a blog. Use your blog to share updates, information about the area, ideas for day trips, tips about travel, and anything else that your target audience would find interesting and relevant.
Step 2: Share your blog posts on social media sites and in email marketing campaigns. Give people excerpts of your blog posts, but drive them to visit your website to read the full posts.
Step 3: Commit to keeping your blog updated. If you don’t have the time or resources to keep your blog updated with fresh content, don’t launch a blog. You’re better off not having one than not providing your visitors with consistent content to digest. Your blog can help you build trust and become the resource that people are looking for, but it takes time, and you have to be consistent about it.
Remember: Travelers want experiences and memories. If you can use your blog content to prove to them that you can be the resource they’re looking for, you’ll easily start driving more reservations through your website.

hotels,"8 Tactics for Transforming One-Time Visitors into Lifelong Guests 8 Tactics for Transforming One-Time Visitors into Lifelong Guests



As a resort manager, a big part of your job is working to drive more first-time reservations for your resort. Your ability to attract new travelers and convince them to stay with you is crucial to your long-term success.

It’s not your only job, though. In order to build a profitable, sustainable business, you also need to be just as, if not more, committed to creating the kind of experience that leads guests to book reservations with you again after their first stay.

The question is: How do you do it? Traveling to new locations and booking reservations at other resorts is easier now than ever before—so how do you get your guests to think about you again the next time they’re planning a trip away? How do you convince them to return to your resort rather than going somewhere else?

Here are 8 tactics you can use to keep your guests coming back for more:

Tactic #1: Go the Extra Mile to Delight
One of the easiest ways to transform one-time visitors into lifelong guests is by creating an experience for them that they believe can’t be matched by anyone else. To build guest loyalty, you need to go the extra mile to delight them at every turn and in every possible way you can think of.

Remember: You aren’t in the business of renting rooms—you’re selling unforgettable experiences and memories that people can’t get anywhere else.

Going the extra mile to delight your guests can mean a lot of things, and it can vary a lot depending on your resort and the type of accommodations you offer. The point, though, is to make your guests feel special. You want everyone who books a reservation with you to constantly be thinking throughout the entirety of their stay, “I’m so glad we decided to come here!”

Not sure where to start? Here are a few creative ‘red carpet’ ideas that might help you think about how to delight first-time guests at your resort:

Send a handwritten thank you card to guests before they arrive for their stay. After they make their reservation with you, send them a personalized card expressing your appreciation. Include a small gift (local food, resort keychain, or a gift card to a local attraction) to help them feel even more excited about their upcoming trip.
Leave a ‘vacation survival kit’ for guests to find when they enter their room for the first time. Instead of including the classic survival items you would expect to find in a kit, fill your kits with food, wine, lotions, sunblock, and anything else that relates to your resort and the area they’ll be exploring.
Help your guests travel around by coordinating and paying for their first Uber ride, shuttle ride, or whatever other form of transportation they’ll likely use. Kick things off on the right foot and help your guests slip right into relax-mode. Traveling to a location can often be stressful. Take the stress away for your guests from the moment they step off the airplane, train, or boat. If your guests will have to rent a car, work with the local rental car companies to create a special discount just for your resort. Don’t advertise the discount to guests—let the rental car company surprise them when they arrive.
There are obviously many more ways to delight guests during their stay, so spend some time thinking about what makes your resort unique, and how you can make your guests smile at every turn.

Tactic #2: Incentivize Guests to Book Again
Another way to get happy guests to book again is by creating irresistible incentives. To make this tactic work for your resort, it’s all about coming up with the right offers, and presenting them to guests at the right time.

Here are some examples of the types of incentives you could offer guests for booking another stay with you:

Free day for a reservation lasting longer than 4 days
Upgraded room for same price as their first stay
Free meals (still charge for alcohol)
Guaranteed booking of the same room or lodge they were in last time
Major discounts on services and amenities (spa, events centers, local attractions and day-trip activities, etc.)
Spending VISA card that they get to use during their next stay (you decide the amount)
Here are the times when and ways that you should present guests with incentive offers:

Try to get a tentative reservation with happy guests at checkout
Include a promotional message about incentives in the receipt you print or email to guests
Include the offer in a handwritten Thank You card that you send to all guests after their stay
Add guests to an email drip that promotes the different incentives you offer and includes clear call-to-action statements and buttons on how to take advantage of the offer
Follow up with guests a year to the date of when they made their first reservation with you. You can do this by phone, email, or letter.
ProTip: If you really want to see if this tactic will work for your resort, make your incentive especially irresistible, but add an expiration date to drive urgency. See if your guests take the offer before they lose the opportunity. Alternatively, you could add a limited amount of incentives (i.e. “we only have 4 of these packages left for the year, and once they are gone—they’re gone!’)

Tactic #3: Keep in Touch
I hit on this a bit in the last section, but it’s important enough to mention again: in order to transform one-time visitors into lifelong guests, you need to keep in touch with them.

You and your reservation agents should be regularly and proactively nurturing relationships with former guests after they leave your resort. There are a number of ways to do this:

Email Campaigns: After your guests stay with you, you should add them to your email marketing list and send them regular emails that include updates about your resort, photos and video, reservation offers, exclusive package offers, etc. In addition to these mass emails that are sent out to a large group all at once, you should also be sending them personalized 1:1 emails from one of your reservation agents. These personalized emails can be incredibly effective in driving engagement and additional reservations.
Phone: Without overdoing it, occasionally call your former guests and check in with them. If possible, present them with special incentives and get them to commit to another reservation. These calls could happen every 6-8 months, or more frequently depending on how soon your guests typically return for another stay with you.
Physical Mail: Send your former guests catalogs, postcards, and handwritten cards from your staff. Again, don’t overdo it with this one.
Social Media: Encourage your guests to engage with you on social media. You could even create a private Facebook group that only former guests have access to. In the group, share exclusive offers and deals that only former guests get to take advantage of.
The important thing to remember with this one is to not overdo it. You don’t want to annoy your former guests, so communicate with them sparingly—just enough to keep them interested and thinking about you.

Tactic #4: Make Them Part of Your Story
To get travelers to come back to your resort again, help them understand how they fit into your history and legacy. One of the best ways to differentiate from other resorts and lodges in your area and around the world is by taking the time to craft amazing stories about your resort, your employees, and your guests.

Make your guests feel like they’re part of what has made your resort what it is today by:

Asking them to share photos and videos of their stay with you
Asking them to write in guest logs or on guest walls
Including media from guests on your website, on your social media pages, and in your physical marketing material
Help your guests understand where to go to see their photos once you do post them online or incorporate them into printed material
When you’re guests feel invested in the success of your business, they’re much more likely to come back to support you, make new memories, and continue helping you craft your story.

Tactic #5: Find Out What Would Bring Them Back
If you’re not sure how you could convince guests to come back for a second, third, or fourth visit, take the time to actually ask them! Get feedback from guests about what they loved, what they missed out on, and what specifically would persuade them to come back for another visit.

You can get this type of feedback in a number of ways, such as:

Leaving feedback forms in the rooms for guests to fill out
Sending survey emails after guest have checked out and left your resort
Posting the question on social media for guests and followers to respond to
Having an informal, in-person conversation with guests at check-out
Asking former guests the question when you call them on the phone to get overall feedback about their stay
Make an effort to collect and compile all guest feedback into one place, then meet with your team to identify common themes and develop incentives that will drive one-time guests to book again. Work with your reservation agents to follow up with anyone who gave you feedback and update them on the new incentives that were recently put into place.

Tactic #6: Stay Active on Social Media
When you’re not intentionally and individually following up with one-time guests to see if they might be interested in booking another stay with you, spend time engaging with your guests and followers on social media.

When your guests are staying with you, encourage them to stay connected with you on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.

Keep your followers updated and their memories of their time at your resort fresh in their minds by sharing:

Updates or changes relating to the resort
Photos and videos of happy guests
Links to interesting articles that relate to the area and local businesses
Messages from employees, managers, and owners
Photo galleries of the grounds, the rooms, and other areas that make your resort unique
Special packages or offers that followers can take advantage of
Live video or streaming webcams that allow followers to see certain areas of your resort while they are away
Blog posts written by you about your resort and the surrounding area
You should also take the time to reply and communicate with guests who post messages on your page, leave comments on posts, or send you direct messages.

Your goal with actively participating on social media sites is to continue nurturing the relationships you established with guests when they were staying at your resort.

Tactic #7: Upsell &amp; Cross-Sell
If you can, try to get to know your guests while they’re staying with you. Try to ask informal questions during check-in or check-out in order to learn more about their hobbies, interests, and preferences for vacations. Take notes and include them in their account file. If you find that your guests stayed with you but potentially missed out on an activity or a part of your resort that you think they would have enjoyed, tell them about it when you’re ready to convince them to come stay with you again.

For example, if your guests commented on the pool or spa area while staying with you, but didn’t have a chance to use it due to the weather, bring it up the next time you engage with them. If your guests came without their kids, but you know of a number of kid-friendly events and attractions in the area, bring it up when you’re trying to convince them to come again.

Your goal with this tactic is to upsell and cross-sell one-time guests in order to convince them to book another reservation with you in the near future. Help them understand what they missed and what they could experience if they were to come back.

Tactic #8: Brand The Experience
The final way to convince one-time visitors to return to your resort again is to simply brand your resort as a place that people return to again and again. Feature stories of guests that have come back year-after-year, allow guests to book the same room during the same weekend every year, and position yourself as a resort that people never get tired of visiting. To knock this one out of the park, you’ll need lots of help from happy guests—work with them to collect stories, photos, video, and testimonials that explain why they continue to come back to your resort so often. Incorporate this content into your website, sales collateral, and email marketing campaigns.

hotels,"The Case for Driving More Millennials to Your Resort The Case for Driving More Millennials to Your Resort



According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are over 83.1 million millennials living in the U.S. today.

Millennials are categorized any person who was born between the years of 1981-1997, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2015, the age range of this group was between 18-34 years old. Taking immigration into account, it’s projected that this generation will peak in 2036 at a whopping 81.1 million people.

As you can see from the data above, the millennial generation is just entering the age of life when they will have the financial means to make traveling decisions on their own. A good portion of them are likely are out of school, in stable jobs, and making an income that allows them to spend money on travel.

As older generation groups continue to age, travel less, and shrink in size, it’s essential that you understand how to effectively target, attract, and sell to this younger, growing group of travelers.

So, how do you do it?

Here are 7 ideas for driving more millennials to your resort:

1. Embrace and Promote Local
Millennials are big supporters of local communities. According to data compiled by FedEx, “some 40% of millennials claim a preference for buying local, even if the goods or services are more expensive than mass-market alternatives.”

Winnie Sun, a contributor for Forbes, sheds further light on this truth about millennials. In an article about millennials and Small Business Saturday, she writes, “This generation likes convenience and supporting local, instant shopping gratification and a homegrown “giving back” experience. Not only do Millennials like to feel a connection to the products they buy, they appreciate a personalized shopping experience and customized products.”

To attract more millennials to your resort, show the dedication and support you have for your local community by:

Incorporating products and services from other local businesses into your resorts. Offer snacks and products to guests made by local chefs and retailers. Decorate your resort with art created by local artists.
Sponsoring community events. Get involved with your community. Become a sponsor of popular events that your guests may see or participate in while they’re staying with you (or trying to find a place to stay). Focus on events that millennials would care about most.
Becoming an expert on all things local. Be a resource for guests. Help them understand your involvement in the community by answering any questions they have about the area, or by offering recommendations about local restaurants, venues, and activities.
Creating exclusive packages for guests that feature other local businesses. Partner with other businesses and attractions to build customized theme-based packages that would entice millennials to stay with you.
The Takeaway: Use local support to help persuade millennial travelers they should stay at a resort like yours rather than one of the other generic or ‘big name’ hotels in the area.

2. Engage Authentically on Social Media
Millennials are extremely active on social media—many people from this generation grew up using tools like Facebook and Twitter as primary channels for communicating with family and friends.

As a resort manager, you should have a clear social media marketing strategy in place that allows you or your team members to spend time authentically engaging with millennials on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Snapchat.

To be clear, you shouldn’t only be using these social media sites as another advertising channel for your resort. You should definitely be advertising on these sites, but it’s more important that you take the time to communicate with people and prove to them that you’re listening.

Millennials don’t want to be sold to on social media sites—they want to build relationships and feel confident that they are communicating with actual human beings.

To attract more millennials to your resort, take the following best practices into account when using social media:

Be consistent. If you decide that you’re going to try to connect with guests and travelers using social media sites, make an effort to be consistent. Spend the time and money needed in order to regularly and authentically interact with followers on a daily basis.
Be responsive. If interested guests can find you on social media sites, they should be able to reach out to you and get a response from you in a reasonable amount of time. Remember: don’t treat social media like a megaphone. Communicate, listen, and respond.
Be human. Help potential guests understand and believe that there are actually real human beings managing your social media accounts. Don’t make them feel like your updates are all automated or outsourced to a marketing agency. Be approachable and real.
Be helpful. Again, don’t use social media to sell. Instead, focus on using it as a way to leverage yourself as a resource and provide value to guests and travelers. Answer questions, post helpful or interesting information about your area, and offer useful advice to travelers.
The Takeaway: Use social media sites to build trust with travelers. Help them get to know you before you try to sell to them.

3. Support Causes
Millennials like to work with businesses that support causes. If you’re a property manager looking to attract more millennials, the buzzword you need to know is “corporate social responsibility.” Corporate social responsibility refers to the effort your organization makes to positively impact environmental and social issues.

Corporate social responsibility is important to millennials, as illustrated through these articles on the subject:

Corporate Social Responsibility Matters: Ignore Millennials at Your Peril from Huffington Post
Corporate Ethics In The Era Of Millennials from NPR
Millennials Are Embracing Corporate Social Responsibility Campaigns from Ad Age
Here are some ways you can show millennial travelers that you align with their desire to make the world a better place:

Support local nonprofits. Find local nonprofits in your area and work to support them in various ways. For example, your team could donate volunteer hours, or you could commit to donating a certain percentage of your profits to the organization at the end of each quarter.
Be environmentally friendly. Work with your staff to keep your resort green. Use energy-saving lighting, post water usage recommendations in showers, donate food to avoid unnecessary waste, and work to keep your carbon footprint as small as possible.
Rally behind a specific cause. If there’s a bigger global cause or initiative you’re particularly passionate about, let your guests know what it is and that their reservations help you support it.
Make your efforts known. Work messaging about your support into marketing campaigns, your website, and 1:1 conversations with interested travelers who contact you wanting to learn more about your resort.
The Takeaway: Help millennials understand and believe that you’re thinking about the bigger picture, and that you care about what they care about.

4. Connect with Travel Bloggers / Instagram Influencers
Millennials aren’t fully convinced to buy services from companies—or in this case, book reservations with properties—by advertising alone. Instead, they look for real recommendations from their friends, family members, and even complete strangers. Research compiled by Ambassador and Nielsen’s Harris Poll Online shows that, “82% of Americans say they seek recommendations from friends and family when considering a purchase.”

To attract more millennials to your resort, you need to proactively work to get more people talking about their positive experiences while staying at your resort.

One way to do this is by connecting with influential travel bloggers or Instagram influencers and inviting them to stay at your resort. Travel writers and Instagram users with big followings can help get the word out about your resort by creating original, objective content about their stay for their followers.

A word of caution: if you do decide to work with an influencer to write a review or share their experiences while staying at your resort, be ready to not like what you read. It’s important to understand that you aren’t paying these people to write nice things about you—you’re partnering with them and asking them to share their honest feedback. That means you risk the chance of getting a bad review if their experience isn’t positive. It’s also important to familiarize yourself with the FTC’s rules on endorsements before partnering with any influencers.

The Takeaway: Work with influencers if you have the budget and know the legal rules—they can help build awareness, solidify your reputation, and connect you to other potential millennial guests.

5. Feature Millennials in Marketing Material
If you want to attract millennials to your resort, you have to convince them that other people like them are already staying with you. You can do this in a few ways:

Share photos of other millennial guests on your social media pages. Ask your guests to post photos of their stay and offer discounts on future reservations as an incentive. You can also hire a photographer to work on site during your busy season to capture photos of guests (ask permission from guests ahead of time and get photo releases).
Create email marketing and advertising campaigns that use photos of millennial-aged people. Don’t use the same stock photos in every email campaign or advertising campaign you build. Instead, build different variations that include photos of people who fall into the age group you are trying to target.
Create custom landing pages on your website that cater specifically to millennials. Create advertisements and email campaigns that target millennials, then send them to a custom landing page that includes photos of people their age, perks they would find attractive (more on that later), and any other information you think would drive them to book a reservation at your resort.
The Takeaway: If you want millennials to book reservations at your resort, make them feel like they would fit right in.

6. Offer The Right Perks
Another way to drive more millennials to book reservations at your resort is by offering special perks and amenities that they specifically might find attractive, based on what you know about their generation. Here are some ideas to consider:

Uber Credits: Make traveling easy and convenient by surprising guests with free Uber credits at check-in.
Free WIFI: Delight guests by eliminating any additional costs associated with using WIFI while they are staying with you.
Smart Home Technology: Incorporate smart home devices and technology into your rooms for added convenience.
Free Breakfast: Roll out the red carpet and give your millennial guests one amazing free breakfast that they can Instagram and Tweet about to their friends on social media.
The Takeaway: Think about what perks you can offer at your resort that millennials would love, then work to make it happen. If you’re not sure what to offer, ask any guests who fall into this age group for ideas!

7. Create Share-Worthy Experiences
The final tip for attracting more millennials to your resort is to simply create share-worthy experiences for guests. Remember: this group is naturally social—they want to share photos and stories about their stay with their friends and family members, and they want to do it in real-time while they’re still at your resort.

As a resort manager, it’s up to you to create amazing experiences for them to share. To create share-worthy experiences for your guests, focus on the following:

Make customer service a priority. Train each member of your team on the importance of being helpful to guests at all times, no matter what role they’re in.
Always work to delight customers. Surprise guests with random acts of kindness, little gestures, and special experiences that make them smile.
Listen, ask for feedback, follow up. Let guests know that you value their opinions and that you are interested in hearing their feedback.
Create intentional spots for guests to create content. Create actual photo opportunity spots around your resort that create opportunities for guests to create content (photos or video) to share with their followers.
Remind guests to share. Include little messages around your resort encouraging guests to share photos and videos of their stay on your social media pages. You can even create a unique hashtag for everyone to use when posting updates on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
The Takeaway: Make it easy for guests to want to rave about their stay at your resort.

hotels,"Stay in hotels frequently. Is requesting daily room cleaning a burden or gift to cleaning personnel? Gift probably isn't the right word. Maybe not burden either. But I stay in rooms, sometimes 28 days at a time, and don't really need it cleaned and my bed made daily. 

I'd rather the cleaning persons make off better than the hotel owners, so I'm curious--does hanging up the ""do not disturb"" sign prevent them from making all their hours, or does it help them by reducing their workload (assuming they'll get their full-time hours in some other way)? If not having my room clean hurts them by reducing their hours, I'll keep that sign down every day. "

hotels,"I'm going to a large convention in Chicago in May and am concerned about renting a hotel room. I'm 19 and my fiancé is 20. I just found out that a lot of hotels rent only to 21 and older, especially when conventions come into play. 

The con is way too far away from our house to drive back and forth and staying in our car is a big whopping no. 

We cannot refund the convention tickets and they cost nearly $200.

What do you recommend we do?"

So I booked ""Delta Hotels by Marriott Burnaby Conference Center,"" I think originally I wanted ""Delta Hotels by Marriott Vancouver Downtown Suites."" Didn't realize my mistake til much over 48 hours of booking. I also booked through orbitz so it's nonrefundable. I don't know the area very well so I didn't know that Burnaby was a little ways out of Vancouver downtown.

Is it possible to change the location if it's under the same hotel group? Just wondering. If not I'm just gonna take the L and use transit to downtown. I'm just staying a single night."

hotels,Checking In: A review for Outrigger Guam Beach Resort 
hotels,"What Hotel Guests Want A Hotel’s top priority always remain the same towards their guest that is to stand above than the expectations of a guest, which always has been a key factor in the successful running of a hotel. Also with technology increasing people after staying at a hotel instantly put their reviews online about that hotel, good or bad or medium, it initiates for the next guest to come forward or not in that hotel based upon the review. Some general points to consider what the guests nowadays expect from a hotel (be it 5 star, 3 or 2 or even starless) are;

Quick check in_ People want their check-in to be fast as when waiting for the rooms to be available, they get their mood shifting to someplace else, and that guest satisfaction begins to drop down if rooms are not available within five minutes of waiting.

Staff Matters_ The hospitality industry appears to be reason why people book a hotel as they expect the hotel staff to be friendly, exceptional and helpful during their stay.  A staff that appears very fruitful can make a huge difference for a hotel business. Their mannerisms stick with guests, if they get connected with them instantly. If guest is paying good money for a hotel, or any accommodation, then they want pleasant staff without any attitudes, but welcoming them with great hosting characters, which still lacks in many cases.

Wi-Fi Internet_ Having a Wi-Fi internet is not enough, but that the internet should be available at high speed without any interruptions in the hotel. Getting instantly touched with everyone via social mode, today’s increasingly connected world expects access to high speed Internet during their stay. So many hotels have free Wi-Fi accessibility but the problem is of its proper viability that makes guest go crackers over their stay.

Rest expected facts include the bed sheets being clean, good food, need extra pillows (soft or hard), bathrobe offered or not, toilet paper, wanting tea and coffee making facilities in room, decoration wanted in the room etc. are some form of things that guests asks to have a nice and warm stay.

These expectations are common for a hotel to run good, but still many of them overlook these facts by chance or they really don’t care is a matter of grave concern to guests who drop in and out before they spread news about a bad hotel experience.

In-Depth Review| You choose a hotel based on the beach, the feeling you get walking around, and the pools &amp; bars.  This one has it all.  The property is divided into 5 separate buildings shaped in three attached “U”s facing the ocean.  The first two parts of the “U” shape are actually the Hyatt Zara while the last section of the “U” is the Hyatt Zilara.  The Hyatt Zilara is an adults only resort, and while I don’t believe I saw a minimal age, I didn’t see anyone below 16-18 years old.  Both properties share restaurants and entertainment; however, Ziva guests can not visit the Zilara side of the property.

**[Read the full, detailed review here](https://loopholetravel.com/2016/04/04/hotel-spotlight-hyatt-zilaraziva-rose-hall-jamaica/)** - The Hyatt Zilara is a great all inclusive resort for a chain hotel.  It's certainly not 5 star quality, but it's clean, beautiful, and has a wide variety of food choices.  The best part about the hotel... it's only 25,000 Hyatt points a night!"

In-Depth Review| The Ritz-Carlton Kyoto is unique in many ways but maybe none more in than it’s ability to blend in to Kyoto’s historical architecture.  Sitting just off the banks of the Kamogawa river, the hotel provides a perfect sanctuary from the bustle of the city just outside the front door.  Designed by Remedios Design Studio, many of the hotel’s 134 rooms offer sweeping views of not only Kamogawa River but the Higashiyama mountains just east of Kyoto.

**[Click Here for Full Review](https://loopholetravel.com/2016/07/09/hotel-spotlight-the-ritz-carlton-kyoto-japan/)** - This hotel was simply incredible.  The Japanese staff really know service, and it's the best of the best at this hotel.  The service you receive here will be some of the best you'll see anywhere.  Concierge was incredibly accommodating and even remembered our names throughout our stay.  The check in process took place in our room.  Anything you asked or needed was a phone call away.  The hotel's location wasn't ideal for shopping or such, but nearly felt secluded a little, which was great.  Walking distance to temples, shopping districts, and more.

**[Ritz Carlton Walk Through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDxv0oo_2mM)** - Video I shot walking through the hotel entrance and room.  Can't speak highly enough of this hotel.

In-Depth Review|  There are hotels and then there are hotels.  The Andaz Tokyo is the latter.  Sitting atop the Toranomon Hills skyscraper, the Andaz Tokyo provides unparalleled views of the world’s largest city.  From the chic interior to the roof top bar, the Andaz Tokyo is a place to be reckoned with.

**[Click for Full Review](https://loopholetravel.com/2016/10/26/hotel-spotlight-andaz-tokyo-toranomon-hills-tokyo-japan/)** - I did another full write up on the Andaz in Tokyo on my blog linked beside this text.  Beautiful hotel in the largest skyscraper in Tokyo.  I used 25,000 Hyatt points for a one night stay, and was not offered any kind of preferred room for being a Platinum member (although, it's not really expected).  The bottom floor of this hotel is the 47th floor and offers incredible, sweeping views of the Tokyo skyline.

**[Video Walk Through of Room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xLD-Nd-UgLk)** - Short video walking through the room including those amazing views!"

In-Depth Review| Dating back to the year 1475, the Gritti Palace holds true to its historic Venetian style interior.  This may be more true now than ever after the hotel’s 15 month, $50 million dollar renovation in 2011.  Since its inception, the hotel has been home to some of the world’s most important people and celebrities.  Danielle and I arrived via the vaporetto (water taxi) at the dock just beside the Gritti Palace entrance.  After walking through a small alley and around a little restaurant, we finally arrived.  Upon first walking in, you’ll notice the hotel’s elegant lighting, Venetian art and decor.  There is no mistaking that you have walked into a true luxury, boutique hotel.

**[Click for full hotel review](https://loopholetravel.com/2016/11/17/hotel-spotlight-gritti-palace-venice-italy/)** - I did an entire, full review of The Gritti Palace on my blog, feel free to read it there.  The hotel is pretty incredible.  Staff was fantastic from the moment we arrived.  The view from the canal balcony could not be matched in Venice looking across at the Salute.  If you find yourself in Venice and are looking for accommodations, I highly recommend this place.

**[Video walk through of room](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AHNpGAeMPg)** - Short video walk through of the room.  The place speaks for itself.  We were given the option of a suite upgrade or canal balcony after booking our standard room.  We selected the canal balcony, and I believe we made the right decision."

hotels,"/r/Hotels Revamp Coming Soon! - Please Read! #/r/Hotels is undergoing renovations!

Formerly, /r/hotels was created with general hotel discussion in mind.  Users came to post content about interesting hotels, asking questions about different cities, and sharing news or reviews.

**Moving forward, /r/hotels will become a ""review first"" subreddit, while becoming a haven for hotel lovers everywhere.**  The sub will also have a strong focus on hotel news, discussions, questions, and conversations  encompassing hotels world wide.

Users from all over the world can share their experiences from their local Holiday Inn to some of the most prestigious hotels in the world.  The current vision for the subreddit is to create standardized reviews that link back up to a Google Maps type environment.  From there, users will be able to search cities all over the world for hotel reviews.

In addition to reviews, members will engage in general discussion about individual hotels and large corporate chains alike.  We are excited to bring to you the new /r/Hotels sub!  **Be sure to subscribe today!**

**What to expect?:**

* Done! ~~We are removing all old posts &amp; clearing out spam~~
* Create a few general rules to help the community grow
* Create a standardized report for all hotel reviews to follow
* Advertise and get the word out there!
* Perform community surveys and adjust rules accordingly

Have any ideas or suggestions?  Please comment below!  We hope you are as excited as we are to bring you the premiere subreddit for hotel reviews world wide!"

For whatever reason, my dog went apeshit on this hotel's carpet. Totally apeshit. She tore up a huge area near the door. 

I'm not thinking of skipping out because there's no way to hide from this. If I fess up, how much can I expect to pay? It's a $40 per night Howard Johnson and I've already payed $60 in pet fees over a week.

I have noticed that (wanna-be) upscale hotels plug all the drains as part of the normal housekeeping service. What's the point? It's trivial, but drives me nuts! Brushing my teeth or washing my hands, and the sink isn't draining. Take a shower and tub starts filling with water. Dammit! Leave the drains open. Every damn day. Why? What's the point? More importantly, how does this possibly enhance my experience? Who has ever thought to themselves: ""Wow, the drains are plugged. This is a *NICE* place."""

We aren't too picky when it comes to food. We aren't into the club/party scene, so trying to avoid areas with large overwhelming crowds. The names I keep finding while searching are Breezes at Runaway Bay an Grand Lido at Negril. Does anyone have any knowledge on either of these locations? Or can someone suggest an alternate?

hotels,I work front desk at a mid level hotel ama I'm at work right now. I'm bored out of my mind AMA.!
hotels,"The worst Hotel experience ever I recently got asked to cover for tech's that couldn't meet their requirements on a major account.  I had to leave town for a week and when I arrived I told the front desk that my traveling companion and 2 other guests would be staying for a week, working at night, and needing to sleep until 4pm for work the next day.

Choice Hotels could not handle this simple request and decided I was some kind of criminal and threatened to have me and my 17 yr old work partner arrested for the crime of trying to sleep.

I spent 2 weeks in mexico at a hotel with staff that couldn't understand a word I was saying (and vice-versa) and had a better experience than this.  I left a good review for that hotel and after this experience I will do the same for Choice Hotels.

Day 1: No reservation, my bushiness associate messed up, late check-in

Day 2: Find out my fellow tech couldn't seep the previous day due to construction in the adjoining room

Day 3: Storm in the area, front desk can't authorize the CC for the room (even though there is no problem with the 2 other rooms on same account).  Call me and wake me twice before noon about the CC, then construction in the adjoining rooms later in the day.

- While returning Thursday AM I tell the front desk to ensure my room is not disturbed because I'm working 3rd shift and have to get sleep to drive home.  Desk girl understands as she works 3rd too and says she'l leave a note for front desk.

Day 4: Front desk calls at 12:30 and says we are 1.5hrs late checking out and we can't extend the room, no rooms in the inn.  I call my business guy he says he'll take care of it, calls back and tells me they *do* have rooms (they lied to me) they just want me to vacate the room for an hour or so to let them install art.  I tell the front desk that is not acceptable I'll vacate the room after sending an email, taking a shower, dressing and packing.  They ask exactly when that will be I tell them ""whatever"" and hang up.

They call the room and threaten my 17yr old apprentice with arrest if he doesn't leave the room now and send three angry goons up to intimidate him.  I called 911 on the way out and of course they were just threatening.

I just thought you all should know that if you stay at a Choice Hotels on business and there is a problem with the reservation, or if they want to install art on the wall, they WILL threaten to call the cops on you.  Don't worry though, they don't have the courtesy to even follow though with empty threats.

Just NEVER do business with them, there are to many other good hotels in the market.

Thanks for listening,
DeadManWalking

I even called the Hampton Inn to see if they can change it but they said there is nothing they can do. I just hate feeling like I have no rights as a consumer at the moment because both sides (hotels.com and Hampton Inn) say to talk to the other. Super frustrating.

hotels,"For those that work in a hotel, what are some possible room assignment issues after event? So I just finished an event 2 weeks ago and booked rooms for 6 nights for my guests (group rate). Today I got an email from the hotel manager that he needs to schedule a conference call with me and my budget manager to discuss an issue on his end regarding room assignments. He was super vague about it even when we asked for more information. Apparently in this call, the hotel's front desk manager will participate as well. 

Because the manager was so vague in his email and this was the first event I ever planned, I am kind of nervous how I am involved in this issue. Is the issue usually big if the hotel needs to contact you?

Thanks for the help!"

hotels,"Marinated Grilled Chicken Recipes :10 Easy Tips  it’s summer! And I don’t know about you, but we have an endless stream of friends and relatives coming over for barbecues during the summer. Everyone always likes chicken, and it’s pretty easy to prepare on the grill if you’ve got an easy-to-make marinade too. Here are 10 Easy Marinated Grilled Chicken Recipes for you to try:

1. Completely Foolproof 100% Delicious Grilled Chicken: With a name like that, how can you NOT try this one?
2. Chicken with Easy 7-Up Marinade: The 7-Up intrigues me. I hope it’s as good as Root Beer Pulled Pork!
3. Herb-Grilled Chicken Thighs: Fresh ingredients completely infuse the flavor into this chicken recipe.
4. Honey-Soy Chicken: This marinade contains only three ingredients. That’s my kind of recipe.
5. Cilantro Chicken: I sampled this at a neighbor’s house one summer, and then I came home and promptly made it for my own family. Even cilantro-weary folks will love this one.
6. Asian Barbecued Chicken: There’s spice, there’s sweet, and there’s lime. It’s good.
7. Chipotle-Lime Grilled Chicken: It’s easy and fresh, and it has a nice kick without being overly spicy.
8. Honey-Lime Grilled Chicken: This marinade consists of only five ingredients, but wow, does it ever perk up your chicken and turn it into something special.
9. Fiery Asian Chicken Cutlets: These cutlets can be served with rice or salad, sliced into pasta salads, and they make terrific sandwiches on crusty bread with a bit of mayo.
10. Grilled Chicken with Lemon and Oregano: A nice, little addition to this one is grilled lemons. They become soft and juicy, and the lemon flavor mellows a bit to add a good drizzle to the grilled chicken"
