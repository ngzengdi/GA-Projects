Flights,"what would you do? awful rule regarding Porter credit Context: I got a flight centre gift card for $500 for my wedding in 2017. We'll- life (having a baby, pandemic etc) happened and I didn't use it until last year.. almost. I booked two flights for Halifax to Ottawa for myself and my 3 year old daughter. The plan was myself, husband and daughter would roadtrip out to Halifax and then I'd fly back with my daughter and he would drive back. After booking my landlord gave us notice he was selling our house and we were essentially being evicted. We did not see this coming and ended up deciding to buy our first home. With the cost of buying, moving etc we decided it wasn't a good time to go on a trip. 

I contacted flight centre to inquire about canceling and they let me know I could cancel and receive a ""credit"" that must be used by April 30 2023. I agreed. (All via email- phone lines only went to voice-mail and stores were not open at the time due to pandemic). I reread the email and that is all it stated. 

Fast forward to earlier this year I remembered time was ticking and I needed to use it. I contacted them and asked if I needed to book by April 30th or book and travel by April 30th. I received an email back saying I needed to book and travel with porter airlines by April 30th. This is the first time I was told my credit was specifically with Porter, but whatever so I started looking at where Porter Flys from ottawa. After weighing my options I've decided to go to NYC for the weekend next weekend and meet my best friend there. I cannot take any extra work days off to make a longer trip (end of fiscal). 

Flights add up to $503.00 online (this is return and picking standard fare including one bag) also this amount online (Porter website) includes fees and taxes. I was prepared to pay the extra few bucks of course. I emailed Friday with a screenshot of the flights I wanted and asked if I booked through them (flight centre) or if they'd prefer to give me the Porter credit info and I book through credit. 

I received a response today stating it will be $341 in addition to my credit because the initial flight was in Canada so this time going to States has more taxes? Also informed me that I can only use the credit from MY flight last year because only the person on the ticket can use the credit.... the other person was my THREE YEAR OLD... 

What would you do? Would you complain, would that even get you anywhere, do I have a leg to stand on?"

Flights,"Scam alert; eDreams Don't ever book with eDreams- more info below

There was an issue with booking my return flight- edreams told me it had failed and I'd have to book it again. They said any charge would be automatically refunded within 10 days. It was not refunded. After days of trying to get in contact I finally received an email from them- only after leaving a negative review. 2 months of muck around, with days to weeks between emails from them, talking first to 'Dina' and then to 'Mohamed,' multiple requests for different bits of info/documents, they ghosted me. I sent 3 follow up emails, and the last two bounced back as the email address no longer exists. They never intended on giving me back my own money, but were happy to waste hours of my time while I combed through bank statements and confirmation emails to provide them with every piece of evidence needed to show that they owed me $240. When they had every piece of info, they deleted the email address. What was the point? If you're thinking about booking a holiday, don't be charmed by their lower prices. Chances are you'll end up out of pocket much more than you would be if you booked with a more expensive, but more refutable company."

Obviously I want to book through delta, but if I try it tells me they aren’t able to show me all the seats for the ANA flight and that I need to go to their website. It gives me a few stray seats to pick from so I wouldn’t get to sit with my spouse and I’d have to sit in the middle.

During the booking, I was able to reserve adjacent seats for all my family members for both legs of the trip.  This is pretty awesome since I have 2 kids (ages 8 and 13), and it would be awful if we are split apart on such a long flight

However, I am worried that our reserved seating might not be honored or will be taken away, even if the plane is not swapped.  How likely is this to happen?  Looking at United's FAQ, it's not clear if there's any guarantee that our family will be able to sit together even if i buy other preferred seating or different classes.

I also have seen United newsroom that they are committed to keep family together based on Biden's recent urging.

I feel so overwhelmed by flight bookings. I'm looking at Qatar airways and have found some really good prices for November-December flights. The return flight doesn't have the ""economy classic"" option - should I assume it's sold out? The medium option has only a few seats left, and the flight there has a few seats left in economy classic too.

 I'm really eager to book it but my partner is indecisive and wants to wait another week before booking. I'm worried it's going to sell out - does anyone have any advice on this?

Since he's taking quite a long time to decide on these things, I'd feel better about doing Jan-Feb instead, then we have more time to look at flights. but the flights are more expensive for January and don't have any economy classic options! Is that because they're sold out? OR is it because Qatar releases them later?

Flights,"FRONTIER: Flight Schedule Change vs. Cancelation I need advice! I booked a direct flight with Frontier from Fort Lauderdale (FLL) to Phoenix (PHX), departing at 7:18 PM 5/26. Frontier notified me of a ""schedule change"" that departs at 1:05 PM on 5/26 (FLL to Atlanta, ATL to PHX - 11 hour journey). There is no chance I will make this flight, I will be on a different plane at this time. My original flight is no longer scheduled &amp; the replacement flight has completely different flight numbers. My understanding is that this would be considered a cancelation. Frontier is arguing that this is a ""planned schedule change"" and therefore, my rebooking options are limited. 

I am having so much trouble finding definitions for a flight cancellation and schedule change. I read their contract of carriage, customer service policies, etc. and these terms aren't even defined. In my mind, a schedule change would not entail a completely different route and flight#. Even the FAA seems unclear about the rules in this scenario. 

If it's a cancellation, I have the right to request a seat on the *next available* flight (which departs the next morning) and they would have to pay for my hotel since it is the following day. But if it's not a cancelation, they offer a refund or the option to change my flight, but I would have to pay the fare difference. The difference in this case is $560 between two tickets. 

Does anyone know what my rights are in this situation? I want to avoid spending additional money and I don't even care how long my alternate flight is. I know Frontier has a horrible reputation but this situation seems especially unacceptable and I feel like I am screwed.

Flights,"Ryanair cancelled my flight, unsure on how to proceed Hello everyone,

My boyfriend and I were meant to travel from Manchester to Berlin on Monday the 13th of March in the morning (our flight was scheduled at 6.20AM) and I have just received (less than 48 hours before) an email saying our flight has been cancelled because of a strike that's taking place on that day at the Brandenburg Airport in Berlin.

Ryanair offered me to reschedule my cancelled flight for free. However, the available flights for both the 14th and the 15th of March were both sold out; our return flight was on the 17th, and given the fact that the only flight Ryanair could've offered us would've been on the 16th, we obviously won't able to use the return either, making both tickets completely unusable.

I cancelled the hotel and I had to pay a £80 fee because I had to cancel less than 48 hours before the check-in date.

I tried to reschedule the flights to a later date (moving the whole trip to July), but taking into account the flight change fees and the flight price difference I would have to spend more than £370 just to be able to use my booked flights later on. 

I am thinking about asking for a refund to then book my tickets in a new booking, but I'm not sure whether I would be entitled to a refund for my outbound ticket as technically that flight is still running, even though I obviously won't be able to use it? Would I be better off to just lose the £180 I originally paid, and make another booking instead? 

I should also mention that the flights were booked as a return trip through Ryanair so I have one booking reference for both flights. Please help, thanks!"

Hi all, my partner and I have two tickets in extra room economy for a round trip flight from SFO to IST in the beginning of April: he is assigned the aisle seat and I am in the middle seat next to him; they were the same price.  These tickets are non refundable.

He is not coming anymore.  Even though the ticket is non refundable, if we call and cancel the ticket ahead of time, he can either be refunded at least the taxes and fees ($500) or get an “open ticket” to use later which he doesn’t necessarily care about.

Ideally we’d like to do that (cancel and get the $500) and then switch my middle seat to his now available aisle seat, but it’s seeming like there’s no way to do this per customer service.  

I’m even thinking of not telling them, him being a no show, taking his seat and then having my middle one be empty, but I realize once the airline realizes he’s not there his aisle seat will be up for grabs to standby passengers.

Is there anyway I can just take his damn seat!?  They’re not making this easy and I’m super frustrated.

My question is, how should I approach upgrading my ticket? 

I’ve done some homework and so far I’ve only seen these options:
- Bid to upgrade (it only goes up to premium, so that doesn’t work)
- Upgrade through ANA Mileage Club using their Upgrade Points (I don’t have any upgrade points, so this doesn’t work)
- Call Air Canada to rebook itinerary, with ANA being bumped to business (would probably increase in round trip cost substantially vs what I paid for initially, so rather not)
- Land in NRT the day of and ask the counter/security gate/customer service/whomever if there is availabily left in J class and pray the cost isn’t gonna break the bank (this is my currently my approach. Current prices are floating around the $8k CAD mark for 2 so I’m hoping it goes down a bit closer to the date.)

My wife is travelling with Iberia from Madrid to Guadalajara, with a layover in Mexico City. His flight from Madrid was delayed by 6 hours for tomorrow morning. The weird part was that they did not reroute her to the next connecting flight in Mexico and said that she needs to figure that out in Mexico City. Is this the correct approach? I have always understood that they need to do the rerouting immediately to final destination so that the passenger knows the arrival time and can base the decision on whether they want to reroute or cancel the itinerary. Now she will basically fly to Mexico without any knowledge about when she will arrive to her final destination.

Any opinion on this? Thanks for any help."

Flights,"Flight Delayed 15 Hours (with a lot of inconsistent info) Hawaiian Airlines Flight delayed for 15 hours - what can I do about it?

Hey Reddit community,

I recently had a pretty terrible experience with Hawaiian Airlines, and I'm wondering if anyone has advice on what to do next. Here's what happened:

My family and I booked round-trip flights from San Jose, CA (SJC) to Honolulu, HI (HNL) with Hawaiian Airlines. Unfortunately, on March 4, 2023, our experience with them was far from satisfactory. We arrived at the SJC airport at 5:15 AM and proceeded to check our bags in the Main Cabin line. Although the plane boarded on time, just as the cabin door was about to close, the captain announced that there was a mechanical issue with the plane, and they were waiting for the maintenance crew to come out and fix it.

We waited for almost 3 hours before being told by the captain that the plane was being deplaned due to a toilet malfunction (which should have been tested before the boarding process). The delay caused chaos in the terminal as one person scrambled to accommodate 200 people. The gate agents informed us that if the plane was canceled, we would be put on standby the next day. The flight crew also informed us that there was a remote chance that the plane would depart that day, but if it did, it would be after 9 PM (we ran into them as they were leaving the terminal).

As a result, our flight, which was supposed to arrive in Honolulu at 11 AM, would be significantly delayed, costing us one full day of vacation with my family and one day of hotel cost expenses (and other expenses) that Hawaiian Airlines has caused me. 

I spoke with a HA supervisor, who had been speaking with management about my request to be put on a separate flight with another carrier, specifically United or Southwest, leaving at 2 PM. As there was no ETA on when or if the flight would depart on March 4, we didn't want to risk not being able to travel that day or our family being put on standby the following day. He couldn't get it done in time, but he's still working on some form of compensation. 

After the flight crew expressed their doubts, we decided to eliminate the risk and bought five ad hoc tickets for our family to go to Honolulu on another airline for approximately $215 each. At about that time, I got a notification on my phone that the flight was rescheduled for 9 PM that evening. Soon after, I spoke with the same supervisor again, and I explained that the new ETA to depart was 15 hours after the original time, and I had no confidence in Hawaiian Airlines' ability to get the plane out at that time. Mind you, that canceled the first flight to Hawaii (Maui) before ours and filled our plane with most of those delayed folks. 

To add to the frustration, we requested that our luggage be taken off the plane so that we could board a Southwest flight, but even though three hours had passed since we made the request, our bags never arrived. So now we're left without clothes and belongings for our vacation.

I'm writing to ask for advice on what to do next. According to the Department of Transportation, if the airline changes a flight **significantly**, the passenger is entitled to a refund and other compensation. Since our flight was significantly delayed, I believe it's the airline's responsibility to make amends. I don't want Hawaiian Airlines' points or credits. I want to be reimbursed for the money I had to pay to make other arrangements after their significant delay.

Has anyone been in a similar situation with Hawaiian Airlines or any other airline? What actions did you take, and what kind of compensation did you receive? I appreciate any advice or insights you can offer. Thank you.

Update March 7:
Hawaiian Airlines offered $300 credits to everyone that took the delayed (15 hours) flight, and a $100 credit to those of us that jumped to another airline in a scramble to get to Honolulu."

Of these bookings, I only flew the BKK &gt; HKT first leg. It was cheaper for me to book an alternative ticket than change the return leg and BKK &gt; NRT flight so i did that instead. Reason was because my plans changed and this was a necessity. 

The first leg of the NRT &gt; OKA was cancelled and i was refunded. 

Is it possible to claim back refunds for the airport taxes for any of these missed flights? They were all booked for the first half of febraury. Or is all of this money written off?

Virgin cancelled my return flight in August of 2022 and none of the next available flights/ reschedules worked for me. After lots of argument Hopper/Virgin offered me flight credit greater than what I originally paid so I took the credit. 

Unfortunately I need to use the credit via Hopper and I’m attempting to rebook with it now but Hopper is trying to claim that Virgin has a $199 fee to rebook with my flight credit. When I took the credit the Hopper agent said there would be no additional fees it was just credit to be used for future travel via Virgin Atlantic. 

Has anyone ever experienced a fee when trying to use Virgin Atlantic flight credit? 
Also should I keep arguing with Hopper about this ‘fee’? Or should I just pay the fee and rebook since it’s $550 in flight credit and it’s better than nothing?

Flights,"Choosing a flight from MDW to OAK this Friday when Chicago is calling for bad weather - chances of delay or cancellation? Looking at a last minute trip and the weather forecast is making it difficult. I want to fly from MDW to OAK this Friday (3/10). The forecast is currently calling for 8.5 inches of snow from Thursday 9pm to Friday 2pm. I know weather is subject to change but I want to book the flight ASAP - which option do you think is the best to avoid a cancellation?

Southwest #644 - Friday - leave 5:20am, arrive 8:00am
Southwest #909 / #1063 (stop in LAS) - Friday - leave 5:15pm, arrive 10:00pm

Obviously the earlier flight is right in the middle of the forecasted snow. But since it’s one of the first flights of the day, how likely is it that it will eventually take off? I don’t care if it’s delayed for 12+ hours as long as it happens at some point in the day.

The later flight is a few hours after the forecasted snow. I have no idea how long it would take for flights to take off after snow stops. I’m assuming it would be tricky if this flight is delayed with the stop in LAS.

Which one has the better odds of successfully getting me to OAK at any point on Friday/early Saturday morning? If neither flight has a good chance, my backup option is  Southwest #1054 - Saturday - leave 8:10am, arrive 10:50am. But I would prefer getting there Friday.

Thanks for any information. I understand weather is tricky but I have no experience flying with bad weather. And since I have not booked yet I have an opportunity to avoid a cancellation."
Flights,"Relocation with a service dog Hello! 

My partner and I live in Wellington, New Zealand, and between September-October of this year we need to relocate to Italy for 2 years. We are trying to figure out the best possible route, considering that my partner's mobility service dog is flying with us.

He (Mr Darcy) has been trained for over 2 years, is usually very chilled but fairly large (32kg) golden retriever. Apart from Air New Zealand, we haven't seen any other airline offering a spare seat for him to sit under, so he would need to snuggle at the feet of our 2 seats (I'm thinking of buying 1 extra seat where possible).

For his wellbeing, we are thinking of splitting our journey into manageable chunks, ideally under 8 hours each, and stopping into countries that legally recognise service dogs like him.

So far my thinking was:

\- Wellington -&gt; Auckland -&gt; Honolulu (1h + 8h35m) \[12 September - Air NZ\]

\- Honolulu -&gt; New York (9h40m) \[15 September - Hawaiian air\]

\- New York -&gt; Milano (8h) \[18 September - Neos air\]

and this will cost us over $2000 NZD per person, with no extra seats or extra luggage (just basic 23kg).

Then we would also add hotels and accomodations in the various stops, and jeez that's an extra $2000 gone.

Anybody else has another idea on how to split this?  
Anyone else has traveled with a dog on the cabin before?

PS: We contacted a pet travel agency to request a quote for flying Darcy with them, but they say Singapore only flies pets under 32kg and Emirates doesn't fly dogs out of NZ any more).

Canadian Travel Agency policy states that:

**Airlines should give passengers as much notice as possible that their flight will be delayed or cancelled. If an airline informs the passengers 14 days or less before their original departure time, they will have to compensate the passengers for the inconvenience of the disruption. The amount of compensation depends on how late the passenger arrives at their destination, compared to the arrival time indicated on their original ticket.** 

 **$500 if the passenger arrives nine or more hours late.**

**Passengers who choose to take a ticket refund instead of alternate travel arrangements must still be compensated for the inconvenience if the disruption was within the airline’s control. Large airlines must pay them $400 and small airlines, $125.**

I'm looking for a return flight from Sydney to Copenhagan for my young daughter and I in September. Although I have in the past used the more respected OTA's and various airlines when travelling on my own,, I now want to make sure I book direct with a good airline as there appears to be a lot more problems happening out there ...

Anyway, I've found a reasonable fare with Scandanavian Airlines which is showing that all the flights there and back are with Singapore Airlines as a codeshare. I also looked at Singapore Airlines and their fare is A$500 more expensive for each of us.

I obviously initially thought 'great', I'll be getting Singapore Aurlines service at a much cheaper price ...

... but will I?

SAS do not have great customer service reviews and of course there's that nagging feeling that if any of the flights are overbooked will we be the ones bumped? Will Singapore Airlines be the one to talk to if problems develop en route? I read of problems re SAS and near bankruptcy? Are any there other possibke pitfalls I should consider before making a decision? 

Would generally appreciate the boards thoughts on this ...

Many thanks"

I noted NS flights out of LA are a lot cheaper, so have been researching both LA and S.F. flights, when I stumbled upon a one stop LAX flight that stops at SFO that is over $1,700 cheaper than the same Tokyo flight, but skipping the LAX -&gt;SFO leg to board the same JAL flight in San Francisco. I can perhaps understand LAX based NS flights being cheaper  than SFO (higher volume out of LA?), but this is the same damn flight with an initial leg added that cost a ton less! Do I just chalk it up to capitalism and “what the market will bear?”

I was logged in to AA through my AAdvantage account, which populated my name ""FIRST MIDDLE LAST"" as I was completing the booking.

Looking at the eTicket and receipt (both Qatar's and AA's) I notice that only my FIRST and LAST names show.

My U.S. Passport has ""LAST / FIRST MIDDLE,"" but the eTicket shows only ""LAST / FIRST.""

I called both AA and Qatar within an hour of booking the ticket and AA said that they ""*do* see the middle name"" but again, it's not listed on the eTicket (and presumably won't be on my boarding passes).

Flights,"Options/recourse for code share flight changes that makes my itinerary impossible? (Icelandair and Alaska Airlines) I posted this to r/VisitingIceland and wanted to make sure I'm not missing anything before deciding what to do.  I'm in the US (San Diego).

I have 4 tickets booked through [Icelandair.com](https://Icelandair.com) for SAN-&gt;KEF via PDX.  I originally booked this about 3 months ago.  SAN-PDX is operated by Alaska (AS 1073) and PDX-KEF is operated by Icelandair (FI 664).  Originally there was a 2+ hour layover at PDX for the connection.  Since booking, Alaska changed their schedule and there is now a 2 minute layer, obviously impossible.  The return KEF-PDX is FI 665, the PDX-SAN leg was AS 1122.  Alaska cancelled AS 1122 and I was put on AS 1196 instead, which took me from a 3 hour layover (which I purposely chose for an international to domestic connection) to only 1 hour.

I called Icelandair and said they could rebook the outbound Alaska flight earlier in the day so I now have a 6+ hour layover.  The inbound Alaska flight would have to be rebooked to the next morning.  I'm not willing to risk a 1 hour connection time on an inbound international flight and coming back the next day is not an option.  I'd like to avoid the outbound a 6 hour layover if possible, but that isn't crucial.

There is an alternative itinerary that goes SAN-SEA-KEF and returns the same way that was pretty much identical to my original departure and arrival times with reasonable connection times.  At the time I booked, the via PDX and via SEA flights were the same price.  Now, it's much more expensive.  Icelandair will not switch us to that itinerary since they are offering the free connection flight changes and if we want to change it is ""voluntary"" and will be almost $400/ticket to make the switch.

I have fully refundable Economy Flex tickets on Icelandair.  Do I have any options/recourse here, or do I just have to bite the bullet and pay for the itinerary change?"

I'm flying between two non-hub airports in a couple weeks here and can't quite decide what to do for my return trip. I can get cheap set of Frontier flights (3 hours each), but...Frontier is Frontier, and if I pay for stretch seating each way it becomes way too much money to pay for Frontier (though I only have a personal item so bag fees aren't an issue). 

On the other hand, I have some Delta gift cards I could use to get a flight to JFK and then from JFK to my final destination for like 100 bucks, but the flight from JFK is 6 hours long. However, the overall travel time is still over 1 1/2 hours shorter because the Frontier layover is *11 hours*. Plus I get access to much better lounges when at JFK and flying Delta, and free Wi-Fi on the flights.

I'm leaning towards flying Delta, but it also feels kind of dumb to fly in the wrong direction just for some marginal comforts and to save 100 bucks lol I've got precheck so theoretically I could leave and explore the city during a long layover without worrying about time (but then obviously I'm blowing money at that point).

Last night, I returned to Tokyo NRT after a week in Hokkaido - which was amazing and I highly do recommend visiting. However, as I was boarding the flight, I forgot a camera bag in the boarding area.

I realized this mistake as I was getting on the plane, however, the flight staff did not let me deplane - they said I could either get off the plane entirely to find my bag (and purchase a new plane ticket), or to stay on the flight and inquire for it later. I chose the latter option.

The flight staff gave me a few numbers to call to help track down my bag. Unfortunately my Japanese is quite limited so I can't explain the situation in as much detail as I would like. All leads have resulted in a dead end so far.

Has anyone experienced something similar before? How likely is it to turn up? Who is most likely the best point of contact: the CTS airport security, the airline (Peach) or the operator of the departure gates (ANA)?

My wife and I planned a trip to Costa Rica over Christmas break. We bought the airline tickets from Expedia. United was supposed to take us from San Diego to Houston to Costa Rica. There were some weather issues but things looked good for our flight. No issues to Houston but then United cancelled our flight to Costa Rica last minute due to no crew available (have text message). They later changed their stance and cited weather issues. We go up to customer service desk and they were no help. 100+ people stranded at Houston and no other flights to Costa Rica available in the next 3-4 days (so standby). They offered us a hotel but we were determined to get to Costa Rica. I went on other airlines and found one way tickets flying out of Atlanta for $2000 (two tickets) the next day. I booked this immediately and forfeiting a day in Costa Rica (hotel, etc. already paid) we made it there.

Now comes the best part. United refunded us $900 for the cancelled flight. My wife spent hours on the phone and submitted in multiple places all our receipts for hotel, airfare ($2000), and the lost day in Costa Rica, which is priceless. This is the message that I got:

Flights,"Skiplagging (somewhat unintentionally) in London? Hi there! I’ve seen a couple skiplagging posts lately, but none that answered my specific questions. 

We just booked a flight from Santa Fe, NM to Lyon, France that has an 8 hour layover at LHR. The flight is mostly AA, with the final leg (LHR-Lyon) being on British Airways but ticketed by AA. 

However, as we were talking about what we want to do during our 8 hour layover, we realized that it would actually be fun to spend a couple days in London if we can. The complication is that we can’t change the flight again because it’s being compensated by travel insurance (long story), and even if we did change it to have the LHR-Lyon leg be a few days later, it would cost nearly a thousand dollars more. However, I saw that there is a British Airways flight from Gatwick to Lyon for just $104 pp on the day we’d want. So, I’m trying to decide if it’s worth it to stay a few days in London by booking this other flight from Gatwick, or if we should just proceed immediately to Lyon as currently booked. 

So, my questions are:
- Is there any risk to skipping the original leg from LHR-&gt;Lyon, and booking a new flight from LGW-&gt;Lyon a few days later instead? Especially since both flights would be with British Airways? Note, the original flight is already booked using my AA rewards #, but I don’t have too many miles right now 
- is it OK to go ahead and book the LGW-&gt;Lyon flight now?
- Would this pose any issues with customs? We are US citizens so don’t need a visa to enter the UK, but I wouldn’t want to get in trouble there. For proof of onward travel, would we show the new ticket (from LGW) and state we are planning to spend a few days? Would they see our existing / original booked itinerary and would that raise questions?
- At what point should we inform British Airways that we won’t be on the original LHR-&gt;Lyon flight? My googling on this topic suggested that it’s good practice to let them know so they can release the seat to standby, but when is best to do this and what do we give as the reason for not being on the flight?
- Should we be worried about our bags being gate checked through to Lyon? We will have only carry ons, so hopefully would have no issues. On the puddle hopper out of Santa Fe, they can’t take normal size carry ons in the cabin, but they’ve always returned gate-tagged bags on the jetbridge at the next airport. 

Thanks for any advice. I’ve never tried this before, so want to make sure I’m in good shape especially since it would be in a different country."

Flights,"Skipping one of the legs in flight with connection - Scoot Hi!

I know that in general, if you book a flight with a connection, if you skip the first leg, the remaining leg of your booking gets cancelled, so even if you manage to show up on the connecting airport, you will be refused boarding. As far as I know, this is used to avoid some of the pricing loopholes of airlines, where sometimes a flight A-B-C is cheaper than a flight B-C, so you could potentially book the whole travel but only take the B-C section.

However, I've been checking with the Singaporean airline Scoot (the low-cost of Singapore Airlines) and it seems that this practice is allowed according to their FAQ?  
See the link:

Flights,Gate checking luggage - are chances of losing luggage lower? I'm going on a trip soon and only plan to bring a carry-on. I have one layover but I'm not very concerned about getting overhead bin space on the first flight. My bigger concern is the international flight after that. It's pretty full and my seat is near the back so I'll likely be one of the last to board and I suspect most if not everyone will also have a carry-on. I'm just curious about whether gate-checked luggage has a lower chance of getting lost

Flights,"Losing my sanity trying to contact Asiana Airlines. Turning to reddit because I feel like I have no other options.   


I booked an itinerary from London to Fukuoka via Seoul a couple of months ago because I am moving to Japan. I booked directly through Asiana's website. The layover time was originally about 3 hours, which I felt was fine.

A couple of weeks ago I received notice that the arrival time of the first leg had changed and now I only have 50 mins before the next flight. This concerns me a bit but I figure it's fine, I'll just contact them for clarification, this is in fact what they tell me to do if the change affects another part of the itinerary.  


The problem is, there is no way to contact them. They list 3 separate for their London offices, none of them get answered. All of them end up telling me 'the mailbox of the person you are trying to contact is full'. Oddly enough, different calls produce different amounts of time before I hear that message, as if they are being manually declined.  


The chat bot on their website only refers back to the same numbers. I am unable to change the booking online because it asks for a 'guest password' which was never provided to me. There is no email contact.  


Eventually I tried calling the US office and was first told that they had too many calls and to try again another time. Third try there I finally got someone but she didn't speak very good English and also just told me to call the London office.  


I'm at my wits end here, I'd go to Heathrow to try and talk to someone in person if I could but I live in Ireland.  


Does anyone know anything I can try from here?"

Flights,"Question about compensation (EU 261) when the cancelation was caused by a technical issue in combination with bad weather. I have tried to look around the internet for an answer, but googling these things are surprisingly difficult. A couple weeks ago, I was hoing to fly home from Oslo. After I boarded the plane, the pilot said there was an issue with the APU and that a technician was on his way to look at it. After 10 minutes, we all got a notification that the flight was canceled because they couldn't fix the issue and that meant we couldn't fly in these weather conditions. And I was rebooked to a flight almost 48 hours later.

The weather wasn't very bad and I was sure the cancelationwas caused by the technical issue, so I submitted a compensation request from SAS. They replied by daying that it was caused by bad weather and attached a screenshot containing some information:

*""Adhoc change: Cnl reason: Weat
Si: Bad weather BGO and APU inop""*

Which makes it seem like there were 2 different causes for the cancellation.
But the weather at BGO was not ""Extraordinary"",as I checked all the flights scheduled to land in that timeframe and no other flights were canceled. (Average delay was 22 minutes when I checked about 15 flights individually)

If the aircraft had been fully functional, as anyone would expect it to be, we would be able to get to BGO. And I feel like they are using the weather as an excuse. But after I replied with the same information I have here, they said: 

*""I have reviewed your case and I am sorry to say that we cannot reach an agreement in this matter.
			
			Please consider this as a final reply from our side, and if no new information will be added we will close the case.""*

Am I wrong in thinking I should be compensated in this scenario, or should I just give up.

Flights,"Delayed Flight Compensation w/ Several Airlines Involved Hello!

We just came back from a trip to Miami, where we unfortunately had a leg delayed by quite some time. Here is a list of the different legs and operating airlines.


Feb 11th
OSL-BRU (Brussels)
BRU-JFK (Brussels)
EWR-MIA (United)

Feb 25th
MIA-EWR (United)
JFK-FRA (Lufthansa)
FRA-OSL (Lufthansa)

The leg that was delayed was BRU-JFK, which took off about 5 hours later than expected. 

Now, this whole trip was booked through united, and we are unsure as to wether the claim should be sent to United, as the tickets was booked with them or Brussels, as they were operating the flight.

After contacting both airlines, we were told by United that it should be sent to Brussels, and the other way around with Brussels.

The delay caused us to miss our connecting flight to MIA, and we recieved food vouchers and a night at a local hotel from United as compensation, making us feel like they are responsible as we already recieved some compensation from them. Has anyone been in a similar situation before and can give a somewhat better answer than the airlines in this instance?

Aditionally, and maybe a bit more complicated, but the delay was caused by a De-icing truck crashing into the wing, forcing the airline to remove the winglet from one wing before we could fly. This took around 3-4 hours, and they then blamed the additional delay on some «paperwork» having to be done. Will we still be eligible for compensation as this may be a «unforseen» cause of delay, or will we be better of applying and rather get rejected later?

All help is much appreciated!"

Airline travel has a much lower per-passenger\*mile death rate than road travel by car, but many Americans still choose car over flight because flights could be expensive. 

Japanese trains densely packed with passengers have good safe records. Actually, very few people are injured. It's obviously impossible to fall, and there were no history of stampede on densely packed trains.

Flights,"Don't believe Aeromexico when they ""Cancel"" your return. It may be a scam. Xposted to r/travel, and TL;DR at bottom

  
I Flew Vancouver-Mexico City-Cancun this past week on Aeromexico. I would NOT recommend this airline to anyone.   
Had an overnight layover in Mexico City, stayed at a hostel, showed up at the airport the next day and checked in with no problem. There was no departure gate on my boarding pass so I went, looked at the screen, and went to the gate listed. Spoiler alert, it wasn't the right gate.

I arrived at the departure gate and it said Cancun, so I sat down to wait. After a little while, I noticed it was getting scarily close to my departure time and it didn't seem like we were boarding, so I looked at the screen again and this time it said Guadalajara. Oh shyte. Went searching for my actual gate, and when I found it, it was too late. I'd missed my flight. They didn't call my name over the system or anything, oh well, I'll get it sorted.

I am told to go to the check-in counter to get it sorted out, so I go back out through a special security door and over to the counter. I explain the situation, and the woman looks at me like I'm a f\*ing idiot, and says ""well that's your fault. Why didn't you get on your flight?""  
Uh, yes, I am aware I messed up, but it seems to me like an easy mistake to make. I'm informed I'll need to go to the sales counter to buy a new ticket. :|

I go to the sales counter, and after also asking me how I could be so stupid as to miss my flight, the woman there tells me that because I have a basic fare and bought a round trip, my ENTIRE trip, including my return has all been cancelled. I'm flabbergasted. Why would you cancel the RETURN?! Apparently, this is policy. I ask how much it is gonna cost to replace my cancelled trip, and I'm given the quote in pesos. 

It doesn't hit till I convert it to CAD. TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. The ENTIRE initial purchase was only $550 CAD. I could cry, but I collect myself and quickly check google flights. I could book the entire remainder of the trip right then for $600, but I decide to just collect my bags (which is a mission in itself) and pop over to the other terminal to book the leg to Mexico with another low-cost airline (Viva Aerobus) for just under $200 CAD. I'll get this shit sorted in Cancun, I have all week to figure it out, best not to make a decision when I'm stressed and I can watch prices over the week. I called their helpline and contacted them via Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger, and was told the same thing, flight's cancelled, that's policy, sucks for you, pony up your cash, dumbass. They were also very very rude about it.

Well, I'm glad I didn't make that decision then and there. All week, I received no email confirming the cancellation from Aeromexico, nor [trip.com](https://trip.com) with whom I booked. My flight also still appeared on their website with no sign of cancellation.

Then, I found a [random blog article](https://loyaltylobby.com/2021/02/01/reader-question-can-aeromexico-cancel-rest-of-the-ticket-if-one-flight-is-missed/) where somebody had a similar circumstance and was able to check in anyway. When I was fairly confident that the cost for my return flight had stabilized (kept watching same-day flight costs), I decided I'd just give it a go. My friends went to the airport the evening before my departure, so I went with them, and was able to check in using the machine with absolutely no issue, and they even still had my prepaid bag on file. MY FLIGHT WAS NOT CANCELLED. I was lied to by the agent who I'm almost certain was on commission. :|

If you MUST fly Aeromexico (I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS), and they tell you that your return flight is cancelled, DO NOT purchase a new ticket until you try to check in. It's quite possible they're lying to you.

Flights,"Flight cancelled. Agency and airline won't cooperate with the refund I  booked an intercontinental flight through Trip dot com. The airline company is Scandinavian Airlines.

The  outbound flight has been cancelled one month prior to the date of the flight, but the return flight is still on. It was not possible to offer a  change of flight, as they cancelled all the outbound flights from A to B  for that month and the following one.

An agent from SAS told me that it was possible to refund the outbound ticket only, and an agent from Trip said that normally their policy is to refund the whole ticket (outbound and return), but since the airline agreed to it, it was possible to make an exception. The SAS agent added a  note to my flight details, visible to Trip, and they acknowledged the existence of this note.

They   proceeded with the cancellation and refund of the first flight, but   today I received this email from Trip: “After verifying with the   airline, we regret to inform you that we are unable to refund the depart   ticket from \* to \* only and remain your return ticket.”

They also added: ""Kindly know that we are willing to do our best in order to  help you but it is all about the airline's restrictions and policies,  so kindly you can send us proof from the airlines of refund approval for the outbound flight only so we can investigate further."".

What should I  do? It seems sketchy that they claim that SAS did not agree,  as they weren't the ones who had an issue with refunding the total  amount.

Also, the fact that their agent added the note to my flight details is what started the refund process in the first place.

Also, since the airline agreed to it and the refund process was already in place, I already booked another outbound flight."

The next flight they booked for me automatically was 5 hours after her (our original) flight which was already a 5 hour layover.

We went to the KLM transfer desk to see if they can fix the situation as we didn’t want to travel apart especially in a foreign country. They said there was an operational issue, which obviously means they overbooked the flight. We were told there was no room on my new flight for her and no room for me on our original flight. 
After a few minutes of back and forth I was told they bump the people who have to cheapest tickets in these events. It was so cheap because I booked back in November. I thought this was absolutely ridiculous that they penalize you for booking early. I would gladly pay more money not to get bumped just let me know how much. She said it was absolutely impossible and there was nothing they could do. 
We walked off and I was furious. Not only would it delay 5 hours, she would have to wait 5 hours at the airport too waiting for me at our destination, not to mention inconvenience the people picking us up.

She then got a notification from KLM saying it’s not too late to upgrade her seat. We turned back around to question why I’m being bumped when there were still seats on the plane. We spoke to a different person.
They didn’t over book it, they were just trying to see if they could get people to buy a seat last minute for absurd rates.

They admitted they do have premium seats available. She received another notification saying an upgrade is just 57 euros. She asked if she upgraded can I take her old seat. They said no.

I asked if I could be put on standby and they said that is not possible.

I asked if they premium seat was available to purchase and they said you’d have to make a new booking, and I said how much would it cost? €978 euros for a 50 minute flight. So I said can I apply the voucher you sent me for €350? They said yes but the price was going to be €628. I told him to book it, as ridiculous as it was. My entire original booking from Boston was $500…

When I boarded the flight I quickly noticed there were empty seats that we not premium.

I fly a lot and have never been treated like this. I am blown away and feel like this should be illegal. Does anyone have advice on what I should do? They guy who rebooked me said I should call and try to get a refund the lady who wouldn’t help me looked mortified and visibly stressed I was making it on the flight after she said it was impossible.

Flights,"Fairly confident checked bag was stolen in JFK while flying Iberia I'm based in the USA, fly domestic and internationally quite a lot. Since an airline lost my bag 15 years ago, I have avoided checking a bag until earlier this week. I'm feeling a bit cursed, as that bag also did not arrive in my destination.

I few Iberia JFK-MAD (direct, which is part of what gave me confidence to check it), and checked the bag a couple hours before takeoff. My partner also checked her bag (literally the same brand and size bag) -- hers arrived no problem.

I did the standard reporting to baggage desk at Iberia in Madrid, so I think I'm sorted until 21 days pass and they admit they're never returning the bag.

The plot-twist is that I have an apple tag in the bag. The day I arrived in MAD, I watched as the bag went from a baggage storage area (at least that's what the satellite photo looks like) in JFK T8, then to JFK T4, then to the highway, then to a specific street of houses in Brooklyn, then to a parking lot in rockaway, and soon thereafter it stopped responding on the road right outside the parking lot.

It seems like a fairly straightforward situation, the bag was lost and stowed, then stolen, and then probably sold. Is there anything else to do beyond the standard reporting with Iberia? The flight was booked via British Airways Avios, so I don't believe the Amex Plat (used to pay the fees) comes into play. I also assume bags are stolen regularly and no-one cares enough to investigate this despite the fact that I can tell them when it was taken from the airport &amp; a fairly decent estimate on the home address of the thief.

Fortunately nothing too valuable was in the bag. It's mostly cheap clothes and toiletries, though I am going through PT and has a collapsable foam roller, some bands, and a couple back therapy books. It has been annoying to re-source that equipment in Spain which I do need do to day."

I contacted AA to see if it could be changed since there are still open seats of 3 together on the plane with our travel date about 2 weeks out, but American Airlines is telling me that they can’t do it now unless I pay extra but they’ll put us sitting together once I get to the airport. They want me to pay $200 now if I want to buy specific seats together. Has anyone had experience with this? Do they actually sit families together or am I better off biting the bullet and paying?

Flights,"BA Club World (aka Business Class) Downgrade on a business trip Hi all, wanted to ask if anyone has experienced this before and advice on how to get better compensation for this. 

I have a flight booked from London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda (14 hour flight) on British Airways for this morning. Because it is for a business trip and I will be attending meetings for the rest of the day almost right after touching down, I have a business class seat booked (aka Club World) and I will be reimbursed by my company.

Tried to check-in online once it was available but was shown an error asking me to check in at the airport. Arrived at the airport this morning and was told that they overbooked the business class seats and that I would be bumped down to Economy, but if there was an empty seat I would be put back in Business. Meanwhile, my colleague who bought the same ticket at the same time was able to check in online a few hours before the flight so he got his Business seat.

I asked if I could speak to someone and the first lady who came was extremely rude and outright ignored me and kept interrupting me when I was speaking but that’s besides the point. Eventually they told me there was nothing they could do and to check with a member of staff at the gate later in case anyone in Business missed their flight. And according to them, I only needed 2 people to be absent to get a Business seat. 

Later on when I reached the gate, I spoke to a member of staff to check if there were any seats available. After checking he told me there was a business seat available, BUT the seat was broken and couldn’t be reclined (???). They would compensate me with some Avios points but he couldn’t confirm what the amount would be. I took up his offer, only to be told 5 minutes later that the seat wasn’t available anymore, so I had to be back in Economy. He then told me they would offer me a refund in the fare difference only and they might offer some further compensation but I had to email in to the compensation department myself to get the base refund.

This was actually one of the first few times I’ve ever taken a BA flight and after this ordeal, I would probably never book BA again for important flights. But just wanted check if anyone in this sub has any advice on what kind of compensation I would be given and if it would be possible to get compensation beyond the fare difference? Is it normal that I’m only getting the fare difference?"

The weird part is that I'm tracking my bag via an apple air tag. The bag looks like it sat in a couple cart storage lots (via satellite images) in terminal 8, then terminal 4, fast forward a few hours and now it looks like the bag is at a random house in Brooklyn, not adjacent to the airport.

Here's the [current location](https://imgur.com/a/zb3DwtF), it's refreshed there a few times over the past 30 minutes or so, so I think it's stationary. The location before this looked like the large Rockaway MTA station a bit to the southeast.

Anywho, this tells me I'm probably not getting my bag (lol), so I'll go through the normal claims process to get reimbursed for this bag + contents, plus the things I purchase on vacation to get by.

Is there anything else? It seems like a fairly straightforward bit of evidence for JFK to figure out who from the baggage crew got off work around 2:30-3pm on Saturday Feb 25th, and lives on that street. Maybe it's a long shot, but my main question is who would be most useful to tell at JFK? I imagine almost every route is a black hole.

Also, should I tell Iberia about this? I worry if I tell them, they will push the blame to JFK or something, and I'll get the runaround for a while."

I put in for compensation and they rejected it saying the reason for the cancellation was ‘adverse weather’ and therefore was unexpected and they weren’t liable to pay compensation, however do I have an argument that they are misleading me? The reason wasn’t the weather itself, but due to the lack of equipment at the airport? I could then make the argument that this detail isn’t unexpected or out of Ryanair’s control, as they know about the equipment at an airport they fly to often, perhaps I could also argue that adverse weather isn’t unexpected in Berlin in late November?

When I booked Amsterdam to Seoul (via Qatar), I wanted to make sure there was an airline I could trust. So I chose to fly with Qatar Airlines because they came top of some lists on best airlines.

Our flight was delayed by 24 hours due to a problem that was entirely to do with them, and not the weather or something outside of their control.

However, this was 2 months ago now. I have contacted them 3 times and they have not replied. Their live chat said on 16th January that they are taking 'longer than normal'. But as it's been so long it seems to me like they're just trying to evade paying.

Flights,"Looking to book air travel within Canada on short notice. Will I be screwed over? Infrequent flyer here.  I am planning a giant cross-Canada road trip (west coast to east coast and then back again) that will take months.  

Approximately in the middle of the trip (the actual date is mid-July of this year), I want to fly back home to Vancouver and spend about 30 or 40 days with the family as I'd be missing them.  Doing this would also avoid the intense heat that is the norm in eastern Canada during the summer.  I'd fly back out in late Aug or early Sept and resume my road trip.

Here's the thing...  I'll be on a slow-paced, often random, go where-the-wind-blows-me type of road trip (in a DIY campervan).  ***And thus I won't know where I will be in mid-July.*** 

Could I be in Halifax, NS?  Maybe.  St. John's, NFLD?  Moncton, NB?  I really don't know right now.  Part of the beauty of my road trips is that they are NOT planned(!)  There is no sense of urgency or time limit or schedule.  (It's the greatest way to travel.)

But now I face not knowing where I will depart from.  And thus I fear that airlines will screw me over with the cost of flying because I'll be booking on short notice.

An example of what could happen is by the 1st week of July, I could (randomly) find myself nearing Halifax, NS.  I'd then park my van in Halifax and then book a Hallifax-to-Vancouver round-trip flight.  

However, if fate would have me near St. John's, NFLD, I'd depart from there.

Basically, I would only have about a week's worth of lead time for booking the &lt;wherever I was&gt; to YVR flight.  

Would that mean super high prices?  Is there any way around this?

One other question:  Ideally, the flight would not be a round trip.  I don't know exactly how long I'd be at home.  I'm only thinking of a round trip because my belief is that 2 one-way fares, each booked on short notice (1 week's notice), would be even more expensive(!)  Would it be much more expensive to book 2 one-way fares?"

So we’ll take the car seat onto the plane for use and would want to check the stroller’s bare base/frame at the gate, which weighs under 20lbs and the side while folded in half is comparable to an extra large checked bag.

The phone agent couldn’t confirm if this would be allowed."

Eventually the deadline passed even after I called them numerous times. And you bet Edreams changed their tune and said the voucher is now expired we can’t help you. Etihad was also useless and said that Edreams is the only person that can help.

Sorry for my last post, new to this forum.

To summarize quickly, my flight did not seem to exist when I arrived at the airport. I nor the personnel could with the information I had been provided by budgetair, find my flight or what flight I should’ve taken. It is clear to me now however, that it was a ”codesharing” flight and that the flight I should’ve have taken had a different flightnumber (7C2667) and was operated by JejuAir.

Details I had been provided as seen in the document (Covered name, ticket number and BUK-number):

Flightnumber: H19947
*Hanh Air Systems*
Online Check-in number: BAAU2V
E-Ticket number: 1691************* 
BUK-********* 

There was nothing in this document that said anything about codesharing or that JejuAir would be operating my flight. The flight number for JejuAir was completely different.

Am I in the wrong here? Am I missing something? I have been to budgetairs website, and they refer to this exact document that I had already been given with email.

Flights,"Upgrade Options Between Qatar Airways and JAL; how much did you pay to upgrade? tldr: deciding whether to choose flight on Qatar airways or JAL and how much is a good price for upgrading to business class. 

Hello everyone! This will be a long-ish post as I feel I need to explain my thought process and what I have researched so far. For context, I am deciding on my next big trip, either to Egypt (specifically Cairo) or Thailand (either in Koh Samui or Phucket). I will be starting my trip in Chicago. This trip won't be until 2024, so I have plenty of time to figure it out, but I love to plan ahead of time. I have status with American Airlines, so I will primarily be sticking to airlines within the OneWorld alliance. Over NYE I was spoiled with an upgrade on a longhaul flight (8 hours) and I don't think I can do a super long haul flight again without business! (longest I have ever done in a row is a 12 hour flight from Chicago to Athens, Greece). I will be 28 by the time of my trip, so I am not in quite the financial position to drop thousands of dollars (think like $8k+) on a flight. If a flight has an economy seat that is around $1,500 RT, I am willing to pay $1k+ for an upgrade to business, but I cannot do the full amount upfront. I have put my name on the upgrade list on AA for miles plus cash (that is what I did over NYE) but my upgrade did not go through until 7 minutes before boarding started, so on a long flight like this next trip I don't want to wait that close to the flight. 

Additionally, after some research, I know JAL upgrades through the ""bidding"" process. I am unfamiliar with this process, to the extent of I am unsure on what a proper amount to bid would be. I would obviously not like to overbid, but I don't want to put an amount thinking it will work and it doesn't. I know this is super subjective, that is why I am asking what other people have put/paid for a flight like this so I know where to set my expectations. 

Also, after some research, I have learned that not every Qatar long haul flight is in Q suite (i.e., one of the flights I am researching from ORD - BKK has a leg from Doha to BKK not in Q suite). Is a Qatar airways flight in business not in a Q suite still worth the money? I think I read that Qatar business is better than JAL business, but I am curious. I think those are all my questions. Thanks guys!!"
Flights,"Most strangest and frustrating flight issue I had. Where to file a complaint? Credit card? Spirit? BBB? Apologies in advance as this has a long context. I would appreciate any help in navigatingmy options post-mess!

On January 10th, I booked myself and my husband a round trip from DFW to LAX for this past Friday, 2/17/23 and back on Sunday, 2/19/23. This was done on Spirit’s website and under one booking and confirmation code, meaning no 3rd party was involved in booking. We also fly with Spirit frequently and are seasoned travellers.

We flew into LAX as planned without issue as usual on Friday, and went about on our scheduled trip.

On Saturday around 11AM, I get an email from Spirit, that says “Modified Spirit Airlines Flight Confirmation: &lt;new confirmation code&gt;”

I didn’t make any request to modify it, so I went onto the app to check on my original trip. Under the original Confirmation code’s booking, only my husband’s name shows up. I felt something was off, so I also looked up the new confirmation code from the email with my last name. 

There indeed was a new flight for me, destination changed to DTW (Detroit) and flight time changed to Saturday night, the night of when this happened.

So I immediately called spirit and talked to three customer sevice reps in the course of two hours:
- rep 1 says I called in around 9:40 am on Saturday to modify the fight. I tell her I have not done that. She says it’s out of her reach and wants to connect me to the supervisor
- It takes 40 mins to be connected to the supposed supervisor. I repeat what I know, and she says I need to request a call review and HANGS UP
- Called again, another rep picks up and I repeat the same thing again and tell her that I’d like to just be put on the original flight back to DFW, on sunday evening. She tells me she “unchecked” me from the flight to Detroit and put me back on the original flight. Made me pay $25 for modification fee. I was able to see the flight to DFW in my name afterwards
So I thought the issue was resolved at this point because the app showed that I’m on the flight to DFW. 

On Sunday morning, I wake up around 9am and see that there was another Modified Flight notification email that was sent at around 2AM. It doesn’t tell me the details, so I go onto the app and guess what? My flight is not even visible there. I put in the new confirmation code from Saturday to look it up, and it tells me it’s an “no longer an active trip” and “no further actions can be taken.” 

This is where I knew something’s grandly wrong, so my husband and I drove to LAX to talk to the agents there. I reiterate everything that I’ve gone through to the agent, and he confirms that on the system my trip is just deleted, and because it’s gone, he’s unable to put me back on any flights. He confirmed that the system shows that “I” have called around 1:30 AM to remove the booking completely. After some digging around, he found that the whole trip was refunded into a voucher that I was not notified of, and was able to book a new trip using the voucher per the original schedule.

Thankfully I made it back home last night, but now I’m a bit lost in what to do. Would I be in the right to make a complaint to Spirit? BBB? It doesn’t quite seem like an identity theft issue, as my bank accounts look intact, other than the pending $25 charge I had from modifying the flight with a customer service rep (will contet this later anyway).

Has anyone experienced something remotely similar? Even the agent said he’d never seen such weird thing. Why was my ticket “divided” and only my trip modified? WHO? was calling in my name? Why does Spirit not verify identity??"

Flights,"Air India Multi City Trip - One Leg Cancelled but the airline has not informed (What are my Options?) Hi Guys,  


I have booked a multi-city trip with Air India, details are below:  
5th May 2023: LHR - BOM

28th May 2023: STV - DEL connecting for DEL-LHR (operating on 29th May 2023)

The ticker is all on the same PNR booked directly with the airline and I booked it in early January since my plans were firm and the price was excellent.

On 7th Feb 2023, Air India released a press report ( [Microsoft Word - Press release\_Enlarged Air India Group Continues Progressive Network Optimisation](https://www.airindia.in/writereaddata/Portal/News/763_1_Revised-Press-Release-Enlarged-Air-India-Group-Continues-Progressive-Network-Optimisation.pdf) ) where they confirmed they are pulling out of STV airport. This airport will be served by Air Asia India instead (but there is no codeshare agreement between the two). One is a low-cost carrier and the other is a full-service carrier.  


Air India has also stopped selling tickets for the DEL-STV route after 2nd March 2023 and there are no possible routes from STV-LHR on 28th May 2023 as per their website.

I have since tried to check with them on what will happen with my multi-city ticket trip as there is no more possible connection with the carrier given they have completely pulled out of STV airport. They have been suggesting that the flight is still confirmed but is not ready to comment on the press release, they never responded to me on Twitter once I challenged them.

My concerns:  
1. The itinerary will not be possible and they will refund me my whole money but until they do, there is uncertainty and the prices for my dates have already gone up, if they cancel is even a month in advance, any new ticket will be unaffordable.

2. They might route me out of BOM or BDQ for my return leg for which I will have to shell out money to travel to that airport by car/train which is again an inconvenience for us.

Can anyone advise what are my options here? How can I force them to really have a look at this itinerary again and give me alternative options or immediate refund?"

However, when I got to the airport the flight did not exist. I couldn’t find my flight with the details I had been provided (flight number etc). The flight company was Hanh Air systems.

I have looked carefully through my email multible times and found nothing regarding a cancellation or delay. There was however a flight leaving from TPE the 18th on the same time as the flight I was supposed to take, but the flight company and flightnumber was different. 

I have since tried to find records of this flight, but can’t find any information that it left TPE or landed in ICN or exists at all. I am very confused and irritated because it seems I have been scammed of my money, altough I have bought from Budgetair before.

(Been to airline websites, searched up flight numbers, BEEN TO THE AIRPORT AT THE GIVEN TIME! I cannot seem to find any information at all!)

Flights,"65 minutes connection in FRA Hi all,

Schengen passport, coming from a Schengen country. 65 minutes connection (on paper) going to Japan.  
On a Saturday but in the evening. Not leaving terminal 1. Flights are lufthansa and partners on a code share. I'll get my boarding passes together and my luggage will follow-up.  
\- Travelling alone, backpack no wheel trolley. I can walk pretty fast but running is not my forte.  
**Can I make it ?**  
Additional info :  
\- my european flight will be on a small CRJ 900 so it's a guaranteed disembark-go to gate by bus in my opinion. So i'm going to waste 10 mins on this i think.  
\- I've watched videos where people film their entire transfer, minus the security and passport checks, it took 40 mins walking at a fast pace if I add the missing parts, so it's encouraging.  
\- FRA website says there are fast passes at security and customs if you have a short connection.  
\- Tried rebooking but everything is full, no other option avaliable.  
\- Lufthansa phone support doesn't answer atm.  


If they close the gate 15 mins before takeoff, that leaves me 50 mins  
I will most definitely lose 10-15 mins at landing with the bus and the whole mess in the plane. That leaves me 35 min.  
I will lose 5 min at security and an extra 10 at immigration. that leaves me 20 mins of walking.  
in 20 mins i can make 1.7km without any travolators so let's say 2km.  


It's so tight I know.  


I'm asking for feedback mostly instead of opinions. Has anyone caught or missed their flight on similar conditions ?

Flights,"SAS flight compensation question (EU) We were traveling with my mother and sister last weekend (February 17) from Helsinki to London via Copenhagen. Landing in Copenhagen was delayed due to storm Otto. When we finally landed safely, we were stuck on the plane for three hours because the ground services at the airport were not operating due to the strong winds. Because of this, we were also miss for our connecting flight to London, in fact the whole flight was cancelled, as well as some of the other flights during that evening.

We queued for 4 hours to the SAS service desk with hundreds of other people waiting to be rerouted. Our new flights were quite a mess, SAS rerouted us to London the following evening and we should have flown from Copenhagen to Stockholm, from there to Berlin and finally to London. So we would have arrived in London more than a day late. However, we accepted these plane tickets because we were very tired and didn't know what to do. We flew to Stockholm in the morning and there we decided that there was no point in going to London anymore, so we decided to return home. We went to the SAS service desk in Stockholm again and asked to be rerouted to our home in Helsinki, a friendly woman gave us plane tickets and we got home.

My question is, how should I proceed in applying for compensation? I know about the EU261 regulation, but it says that the airline is practically exempt from compensation if the delay/cancellation is due to ""exceptional weather conditions"". I don't want to admit this, but to be honest, I think that criterion was met in Copenhagen when the whole airport was closed for a few hours due to a storm.

Is there any chance we can get a refund from SAS? I already filled out the EU261 compensation application from the SAS website, but the decision takes several weeks and I'm pretty sure they won't compensate anything.

Our return flights from London to Helsinki (February 25) still appear on the SAS website in my bookings. I'm wondering if I should cancel the return flights from there and get even a part of the ticket price back? They offer me €140 and that is basically the tax portion of the return tickets, the tickets were around €1000 in total."
Flights,"how to approach changing an upcoming European SAS flight ahead of a separate Delta flight? Hi All,

I have an upcoming SAS flight from Europe to London (and a few days after landing, I have a flight back to the US via Delta) but unfortunately am battling some head congestion and am not sure if it would be the safest to fly, given issues with sinuses on flights (and potentially being contagious—I tested negative for covid and have a history with messed up sinuses, but I don't know if I can be sure without going to a doctor). I have the opportunity to extend my current European stay a few days to rest up more (I booked flexible lodging just in case), and my SAS flight to the UK is booked as SAS Plus Pro so I know the ticket is changeable.

My question is: if I'm not feeling better / fit to fly, what's the best way to rebook my SAS flight? Could I in theory go on the website Tuesday if I'm not well enough and change Wednesday's flight to Saturday? Would I need to be at the mercy of whatever flights are available to rebook? What if I feel better Thursday and already redid everything for Saturday? I've never had to change plane tickets before. I need to be in London by this coming Saturday night before my Sunday flight back (separate tickets, and not SAS's concern really), so I could in theory fly any time before then, as long as I'm up for it. My plans were to stay with family in England before Sunday so while a bummer not to see them, it wouldn't be the end of the world and I would likewise have flexibility in coming in another time besides our scheduled Wednesday. 

I thought I'd reach out and ask here, because I'm feeling very overwhelmed by the entire process. If it's relevant, my UK flight back to the US was also booked as refundable and so probably is also changeable, but I'd rather not touch that reservation, though of course can be flexible. I just would really like to know my options, be responsible, and also not, you know, feel stranded in a foreign country. 

Thanks for any input!"

Plans have changed for me and I want to change my flight to BOS-BCN (Boston to Barcelona) on April19/20th. New booking costs put the fare at around $600, give or take. For some reason AF website doesn’t let me change my booking through their website. I’ve called them and they want to charge me $800 for this same $600 flight that I’m seeing. Why is there such a difference between what I see on the website and what they see? 
I even tried to change my booking to a random cheap flight ( $100 flight from BCN-Amsterdam for May 25th, random place and date but cheap) and they still want to charge me $720 for the same $100 priced flight that I see on their website. 

They claim that the cost difference is because I’m changing a flight vs booking a new one but I have changed bookings through their website in the past and was able to book without much of a fare difference so this is definitely not true. I wish I was able to change my flight through their website still but there seems to be a technological issue happening. 

Does anyone know why I am being charged so much more money over the phone? There is no fee for changing a flight, just fare difference. So why I am seeing flights that cost hundreds of dollars less than what the AF representatives are telling me? I just want to change my flight without paying $200 more.

Flights,"Asiana changed its flight times, making my layover impossible. Their offered ""alternative"" is terrible. What are my options? I have a trip planned to Japan in april. We booked flight tickets from Asiana airlines (via booking.com).

[Here](https://i.imgur.com/UIxvamA.png) is the original flight plan.

Unfortunately, Asiana pushed the departure time of the flight between Seoul and Frankfurt forward to 09:40 AM. This means we can't reach it, as we would only arrive in Seoul at 11 AM. They just sent us an email with an offer for an alternative flight. However, it's quite a bad one, as it not only includes an overnight layover in Seoul, but also an airport change from Gimpo to Incheon, which means we'd have to go through immigration for Korea.

I'm not sure what my best options are. We could cancel, but alternative flights are *extremely* expensive now. However, I read that according to EU law, I could book a different flight and Asiana would have to pay for the difference in price. Is this true and how would I go about getting this compensation?

Full story

Received text when boarding in Calgary saying there’s been a change and I’m now sat in an economy window seat. 

Land in Toronto and go to the desk. They say the seat is broken on our Toronto to São Paulo leg and it’s unsafe for use. I’m upset but I get it. The staff told me to contact AC for a class-difference refund on this leg. 

At the gate I’m called to the desk. I’m given a new ticket with a middle economy seat. I explain I understand the change due to the broken seat, but I have a text saying I at least have a window seat. 
The agent says none of that’s true. I’ve been bumped because of an aircraft change and the middle economy seat is the only option, or I can fly the next day. 
I vocalise that this is a little upsetting as I’m flying with my partner on a special trip. 
The agent says “or you can both travel tomorrow, up to you, it’s not my vacation”. 

We grit our teeth and board as we don’t want to delay our special trip. My partner sends me a photo from business class showing a Pilot sat in my original seat. There wasn’t a broken seat or an aircraft change, it was a Pilot being relocated(?) to pick up a leg. This really bothered me as I was lied to by 2 different sets of staff.

Flights,"Denied compensation from TAP Airlines My wife and I tried to fly home with TAP in summer August 2022. We had booked a multi-city ticket and the plan was to return home on August 2nd from Porto (OPO) - Lisbon (LIS) TP1947 at 07:00 and then Lisbon (LIS) - Toronto (YYZ) on TP257 at 10:40.

The night before, I noticed I couldn’t check in to the TP257 flight online and was instructed to go to the gate when I called customer service. 

In the morning we went to the Porto airport and were issued a boarding pass for TP1947. They again told us to go to the gate in Lisbon.  I was already worried it was overbooked or we’d be put on standby.  The Porto flight was delayed somewhat due to fog. However, we arrived in Lisbon with more than enough time to get to the gate before boarding.

At that point we were told to wait and sit aside.  We were explicitly told several times by different TAP agents that the flight was overbooked and we needed to wait to see if there were seats available.  A few became available but went to other passengers. In the end we did not get on the plane, along with about 12 others. 

There was no weather delay in Lisbon or any other discernible restriction I can think of. The flight left on time without us. Everyone from TAP we talked to said that we would be fully compensated for denied boarding. Every agent used the word “overbooked”.

They did get us a hotel room and put us on a series of flights the next day that ultimately got us home about 36 hours later than originally intended, via Amsterdam. They offered 1000 euro flight credits each on the spot but we denied that because they said we could instead apply for the cash option.  We were pretty upset at the time and my wife was quite pregnant. 

6 months later, my TAP claim for compensation has been outright denied. They are saying the delay was due to “Restrictions in effect at the airport beyond our direct control.” I specified in the complaint that we were denied boarding. 

Am I crazy or am I misunderstanding the rules here? Or are they trying to get away with it?"

Flights,"Air France Refund Request - Changed flights and Pregnancy Afternoon All,

&amp;#x200B;

In November 2022, my wife and I booked our Covid-delayed honeymoon with Air France for Cuba in March 2023. Route and dates:

NCL - CDG - HAV 25/3/2023

HAV - CDG - NCL 10/4/2023

&amp;#x200B;

Within the month, AF had cancelled my return flight, saying it was no longer operating. After much back and forth over customer service messenger, and another cancelled flight, we rescheduled our return leg for 13/4/2023.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward 2 months and my wife discovered she is now pregnant. As an anxious person, she would feel quite stressed to travel while pregnant, even within the first trimester. Particularly as Cuba is on a list for countries with a risk of Zika virus. We got a doctors note advising her not to travel due to these reasons.

&amp;#x200B;

After contacting AF customer service again, they refuse to issue a refund (or a voucher) for our flight even though we have a medical note advising against travel. Is this allowed? I am currently processing a refund request but this would be lucky to refund £600 out of a ticket cost of over £2,000!

&amp;#x200B;

To me, this doesnt feel right so Im asking if there any avenues I could also consider. I have consulted some other posts on this subreddit, and unfortunately I do not have travel insurance. My credit card only covers insurance for accidents while abroad, a costly mistake to make. Is there anything we can do? Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"
Flights,"Airline lying about reason for delay to avoid EU261 compensation I was on a flight in late January which was 188 minutes delayed on arrival in Lyon, France (the 3+ hour delay was verified on flight tracking websites). 

&amp;#x200B;

When we boarded the plane, the pilot told us that the original aircraft had a mechanical error and that a new aircraft had to be flown in empty from Nice to facilitate the flight, hence the delay. The new aircraft was a larger model (my seat in row 13 was was originally 2 behind the emergency exits but was now an extra leg room window seat, which was a nice surprise). I mention this because there's definitely a paper trail of this extra aircraft being flown in and being of a different model.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, my 3 friends and I made an EU261 compensation claim for €400 each the week after the delay, as it was a 1500-300-km intra-EU flight that was 3+ hours delayed on arrival for non-extenuating circumstances. However, I received a reply today from the airline (Volotea) saying that the delay was caused by ""airport restrictions"" (some friends flying from a different country to the same destination mentioned that there were some sort of strike action in Lyon that day, but it seemed to have no impact  on us and was never mentioned by the airline).  


I've pushed back hard and threatened reporting them to the French civil aviation authority plus initiating a consumer rights violation for fraudulent reporting of the delay, so hopefully that will set them straight. As a group the delay costed us hundreds of euro in knock-on costs and even the food vouchers they were required to give us in the airport didn't work, so the whole thing is pretty scummy.  


If anyone has any advice or specific suggestions, I'd appreciate the help."
Flights,"International flights through the US- do we need visas to pick up our luggage? Hello, my spouse and I are looking to fly across the Atlantic to Canada and many of the flights go through the US. However, every single flight through the US says the baggage is not automatically checked through despite both flights being international. We would have to pick up our baggage and check it back in, depending on the airport the terminal may also be different. 

For people who need a visa to enter the US, would it require a visa to pick up our bags and drop them off? I mean would we have to go through immigration for that?

I booked an economy return flight with Oman Air using my maiden name. At the destination country I changed my last name to the name of my spouse due to marriage. 

There is no official information about such a case on Oman Air\`s homepage. But I read online in various forums and also here in r/Flights that almost every Airline will allow the name change for the return flight due to marriage if you present the right documents to support it.

Not so for Oman Air. The customer service told me, that a name change is not allowed and we have to buy a new ticket. The customer service agent was not even interested in the documents (Old passport, certificate of name change, marriage certificate), I have to prove that I am still the same person flying back.

Interesting are also various online posts that state, there was no problem changing their last name with Oman Air in this specific case. I am just not the kind of person to cause a scene at the airport so I wanted to clarify everything beforehand.

In my opinion it is not a customer friendly policy. I should buy a new ticket even I paid the regular price for the ticket, tried to clarify it in advance and have all legal documents ready to prove I am still the same person. What are your opinions? Do you have similar experiences with Oman Air?"

I could not find any info on their website or in my ticket T&amp;C about how refunding just the departure flight worked.

I bought a different flight (I was desperate at this point) and went on my trip as planned with a different airline. I checked the SAS flight I cancelled and found out it was indeed officially cancelled by SAS the next day.

I did not get any information on the refund for over 2 months (despite them saying 2 weeks). Then I see the refund notice: $5.60. SAS informed me that because I only cancelled half, that was the proper refund (because one ways are more expensive). My argument is that if I had known that was the refund amount I would NEVER have requested it. I would have waited for it to be cancelled (and it was, the day of). I couldn’t find ANY information on how it worked on their site. I am so frustrated at how much money I wasted due to their strike. Do I have any recourse or way to complain?

Extra info: this is actually my grandma’s ticket I bought for her. I only cancelled the first half because she had arranged for a travel buddy to accompany her back from Europe because she is 86 and couldn’t travel alone. I didn’t want to cancel that flight she had coordinated with her buddy."

I was also tempted to be a  no-show on the final leg and rebook, however i have been told if i am a  no show on my final leg flight, they will cancell all my return  flights, and also all my luggage will end up in Sydney anyway.

Swiss  air have confirmed it is possible to either terminate outbound flights  at Singapore or change the date, however because I booked with a 3rd  party they will have to do it. (Contact the trade supply line and  recalculate the taxes etc.)

Last  minute wont do this though..I am at an impasse. I am happy to pay what I  need to. I dont understand why they will cancel my return leg if i  notify them i dont want to use the final outbound leg.

Does  anyone have any ideas on what I can do?

1st flight from Los Angeles, my body went through mast cell activation (breaking out in hives everywhere) after successfully recovering from COVID prior to my travels. I didn’t have any allergy meds on me, I’d asked the flight attendants for help even before takeoff while people were still boarding. Soon after takeoff, I had trouble breathing from the sudden allergic reaction. It took me convincing them for 3 hours and having a nervous breakdown to finally get in contact with a doctor to prescribe me whichever medication most suitable that they had on board for my condition. 

2nd flight from Taipei to Ho Chi Minh City, (a little TMI but my period also started mid-flight). I simply rushed to the lavatory to quickly tend to my girly situation. I hadn’t even been in the lavatory for a minute or two before a rude ass woman started trying to pull open the door. I politely asked her to give me at most a couple minutes so I could at least secure my sanitary pad, wash my hands and get my pants back on 😂. She started banging on the door and forcefully tried to open it. When I went out, I was for sure in a very heated state (also granted the menstruation hormones… LOL). I got out, stood at the door, and told her to not fuck with a girl on her period WITH HIVES STILL BREAKING OUT ALL OVER MY BODY. *FLIGHT ATTENDANTS DID NOT STOP HER FROM HARASSING ME WHILE I WAS IN THE LAVATORY NOR DID THEY STOP ME FROM LETTING OUT MY HEATED RAGE*. Note, I let Jesus hold me back and I didn’t get physical with her. 

My flight back home to LA from Taipei, there was a guy being a total racist jackass to these two kids, cursing at them with racial slurs and pushing them into a wall while at the boarding gate. They weren’t even doing anything wrong, just playing with each other. No one (including airport staff, flight attendants who were present), did Jack shit. I tried asking the kids in English if they knew him, but they turned out to not even speak English. So, I communicated in Vietnamese with them. They were two young Vietnamese boys who did not know who that jackass was. I spoke up VERY loudly and let the guy (and everyone around us) know that he was a fucking asshole. What appalled me more than that guy’s jackassery was the lack of willingness from everyone to help those two kids. No one did anything either while I stood up against the jackass.

Flights,"Is ""damage in the air"" on a previous route out of an airline's control? Had a flight delay flying out of the EU to Australia with Turkish Airlines which led to missing all my connecting flights and arriving 12+ hours late at my final destination.

Upon contacting Turkish Airlines they informed me that I was not eligible for compensation as the aircraft that was meant to be used for my flight was ""damaged in the air"" on a previous flight, and that they deem this as being ""out of their control"" and therefore don't need to pay compensation.

I asked for proof of what exactly occurred but was not given it. ""Damage in the air"" is incredibly broad and could easily be an issue stemming from a variety of issues such as lack of maintenance, for example. I also suspect this may be a cover up for a mere mechanical issue which is normally classified as within an airline's control, as we were told just that on the ground prior to the replacement plane arriving.

Do I have any way of finding out what exactly occurred and whether or not I really am entitled to compensation?

Flights,"Is 2hrs connection in Zurich sufficient? I've booked a United Flight between Newark and Zurich, and on a separate itinerary I've booked Singapore first between Zurich and SIN. 

Since I'm on two itineraries, I'll need to clear immigration, grab my bags, check-in for my Zurich&gt;SG Flight, clear security and immigration again, and get to my gate. 

It looks like the United flight arrives at 840a.m., and the SQ flight is out at 1035a.m., so that gives me roughly two hours to to through this process.

Flights,"Question about re-checking bags Hello, I'm very inexperienced in flying but am moving overseas this May. I booked a self-transfer itinerary that crosses three different carriers, so I'm just assuming that I will be paying checked baggage fees for all three. I've been trying to find an answer to this question, but have found a lot of mixed results, so:

My biggest anxiety right now is re-checking my bags during a 2 hour layover in Kahului. Some people have told me that's plenty of time, others have said it's nowhere near. I'm paying my checked baggage fees in advance, and getting pre-approved for TSA. Is there anything else I can do to give myself the best possible chance of making my connection? Does anyone have experience with OGG or re-checking bags in general that they could share to help me plan as thoroughly as possible?

I've looked into having my luggage shipped to make it easier, but it would cost several hundred dollars more and I'd like to be able to avoid that if possible. I'll be checking one large box that contains my computer case and components, and one suitcase. If it's not feasible, and I should ship these instead, I'd appreciate advice. Thank you!"

Flights,"Flying to Bali in may Hi all, a friend and I are flying to Bali, Denpasar airport on the 11th of May, returning on the 29th of May.

When we were first looking a few weeks ago prices were £700, now they are £809. I understand this is most likely due to space on the plane itself, it is also schools half term in Britain when a lot of brits are booking holidays. 

Is it possible that they will come down between now and March? 

Or should I just bite the bullet and book now?

It’s my first time booking international flights so I have little experience, but I think we should have booked them before when they were £640-700😅. The closer to the date = less availability = a higher price. Demand and supply. Plus fuel costs maybe?

Flights,"Volaris cancelled the flight. Are we owed anything extra? Recently, my mom, sister, sisters baby and I had to fly to Mexico for the unexpected death of my grandpa. On the flight back from Mexico to Los Angeles, the flight ended up being cancelled. Initially, delayed due to a maintenance issue but then cancelled as it was too late to fly internationally and go through customers. 

The original flight was supposed to depart at 10:15pm MX time and arrive at 11:40pm LA time. 

Due to the delay and deplaning, we were at the desk of a Volaris’ agent around 12:20am MX time to reschedule our flight. They informed us the next flight available was 6:51am MX time. 

When I asked about food/accommodations they indicated since we would need to be back at the airport 3 hours before, we would not qualify. It’s pretty frustrating spending the night at the airport, including spending it with a baby. We had to buy additional food, milk, etc. 

They did provide us e-vouchers ($200 credit for a future flight). 

Would this be all we are entitled to based on their policy?

Flights,"General advice about travelling with credit card points? So, with a little help from Reddit, I picked out a travel rewards card (Capitol One Venture One) in 2015 and flew completely on points to NYC two years later for an epic trip. Now I'm casually looking at options for what to do with my new points in the fairly distant future and am looking for general advice.

Some questions and notes to give an idea of what I'm looking at. I'll start with the ones not specific to my situation:  


\-What should everyone know about credit card points that isn't immediately obvious?

\-Is there a best time of year to book trips with points, or at all? I was browsing in January and that was blowing away rates I got in other months.

\-Can travel agencies book you on points, or are they cash only?

\-What, if anything, would I be charged if I transferred my points to another card?

\-Is there a subreddit that's better for asking these kinds of questions?

\-Do I have a good card? I kind of like it, especially the lack of annual fees, and the flexibility of using it with whatever airline or hotel chain I want. My second-closest airport is an American Airlines hub, but there's a hundred reasons to fly with someone else, especially internationally. I kind of like my ""generic"" card. Are other cards, including ones for the airlines, especially better?

\-We're in the Greensboro, NC area. My current dream trip is to take my wife to the Samoan islands where I once lived, and the best way there is through Hawaii. But dammed if that isn't an expensive one. But wife would like to actually visit Hawaii before merely using it as a stopover, and that's more doable in the shorter term. That's my second choice. My third choice is Paris.

\-Here's where it gets weird: According to the CapitalOne's (henceforth known as C1) points redemption page, we could drive up to DC, stay overnight with family for free, and fly to CDG in Paris with the points I already have (albeit paying for everything else out-of-pocket) thanks to Play Airlines. But somehow I'm only about 51% of the way to having enough points to fly us to Hawaii on points. Is that normal? I know Play is cheap, but damn.

\-It seems to have something to do with the C1 site's tendency to want to keep you on one airline. The current best option doing that is CLT-LAX-HNL on American. I toyed around on Kayak and I can do the same trip for like $400 cheaper, still more points than I have ATM, by flying American from CLT to Vegas and switching to Hawaiian Air there. I browsed the subreddit FAQs, is there a way to pay with points and still do that one one ticket? Or would I have to do separate tickets and risk problems?"

I have been traveling a lot lately and I am considering which membership I should choose. I am based in Europe and I usually do the same trip, within EU, almost every week.

I used to have a Miles&amp;Smiles (Turkish Airlines) but I am considering to change to Miles and More (Lufthansa et al), because for some reason the miles were not credited automatically to my membership and it is a pain to add them manually.

Last year I did over 50 flights.

For Miles&amp;Smiles I need 40.000 miles to achieve Gold status, I am not sure if I gathered so many miles since I fly economy on the cheapest fare I can find.

For Miles and More I need 30 flights within a year to qualify for ""Frequent Flyer"", which, if I understand correctly, will allow me to access the lounge and I assume also priority boarding, but I am a bit confused with the information I find online.

My main concern is to be able to access the lounge (both domestic and international for Turkey, when I occasionally travel there), both me and my family (wife/ child) and if possible to have priority boarding. 

What would you recommend me? Will the Frequent Flyer status from Miles and More be enough? Is there a better option that I haven't thought of (e.g. Aegean membership)?

Flights,"Why was my flight ticket cancelled when the flight is still running? So this is about a past flight, but to this day I am confused and just curious why this happened. Therefore this post is only for curiosity sake.

I previously booked a flight with two legs with Lufthansa, London to Frankfurt then Frankfurt to Korea, as it was the cheapest option from the UK to Korea. Direct flights are expensive and I didn't mind, I have a UK passport so I had no problems entering Germany for the layover.

Anyhow, all was good until the flight London to Frankfurt just **would not stop** getting cancelled! First flight was cancelled for everyone and checked on Google, flight was cancelled. I didn't really think much of it as this was a good few weeks before. I changed to the later flight with them for the same day at no additional cost, but had to do it over the phone since online my booking was all messed up on their systems as it was a 'joint transfer' ticket attached to my Korea flight too.

Then, about 2-3 days before my flight, I get an email from Lufthansa my flight London to Frankfurt was once again cancelled. But this time the flight was running and they were still accepting purchase of tickets by new passengers. But for some reason *my* ticket was cancelled?? I called up Lufthansa and they said they couldn't discuss why tickets were cancelled. I just shrugged it off, and then over the phone they booked me onto another one which this time they didn't kick me out of FINALLY. But just my bad luck all Lufthansa flights ended up being cancelled that day 24h before because of Lufthansa only strike action at Frankfurt airport. In the end, I had to book another airline as ofc all Lufthansa flights weren't running last minute to get to Frakfurt in time to reach my (next day when strike was over) Lufthansa Frankfurt to Korea flight the following day. Got my money back for the cancelled Lufthansa flight, and as for Lufthansa Frankfurt-Korea A-OK had zero issues, checkin on mobile was fine, never cancelled. So I guess short term flights with Lufthansa are just the ones that are a nightmare.

Has anyone else been in this situation or can enlighten me why they'd randomly kick off a passenger from a ticket from a running flight? I have had zero issues associated with travel before in my life.

\[The rest of this post below is kinda a rant about my experience with Lufthansas admin so can be ignored if you like\]

My experience flying with Lufthansa was actually really good, but I had nothing but technical problems and cancelled flights on their admin side. I always had to call their customer services, wait an hour to get through, because their online booking site kept not letting me change flights when they were cancelled because the 'joint transfer' ticket just made the system confused. Their computer systems and customer service always had SOME issue with my booking, maybe because it was a transfer flight, maybe its because I booked with Google Flights. It was always a ticketing problem with them, as on my leg back Korea-Frankfurt Frankfurt-London, none of my flights got cancelled but I couldn't check in online for either, for some reason, I can't remember the error code, but their Korean phone lines weren't open on Fridays so I frantically had to google the error and had found on Twitter their account had replied to someone with the same issue, and told them they should be able to check in in the airport and that their ticket was just 'flagged to make sure they were actually gonna be on the flight' or some shit like that. Luckily, the Lufthansa staff at Incheon Airport were amazing and they just said yeah it happens sometimes and we don't know why and within 2 seconds in the airport I was checked in, though with a middle seat because I couldn't check in online and get the good seats lol. But again why was their system such a nightmare... I've never had this with any other airline.

Anyways, moral of the story, it's always worth it for long far flungs flights to pay that extra £200 for direct haha."

Flights,"Air France flight delay/compensation question Hi all, looking for some advise here. My husband and I had a flight from San Francisco (SFO) to Istanbul. The connecting flight was in Paris. Apparently there was some “issue” with the air filter on the plane. This issue caused us to leave SFO severely delayed. When we arrived to Paris, everyone on that flight missed their connecting flights. So my husband and I were stuck in Paris. 

We immediately received an email saying we’re entitled to voucher or refund. We started the process and earlier this week, Air France requested our back info to process the refund. Now Air France is denying our refunds after we sent our bank info. The rep said that since we left from SFO we’re not entitled to a refund. This doesn’t sound right to me, especially since initially they said we were. 

Does anyone know who I speak to regarding this? Is it Dept of Transportation in the US? I called Air France and there’s no direct number to speak to this compensation/complaint dept. I’m really pissed because on top of this, they also lost our baggage on the return trip home. We should be entitled to a refund for essentially being stranded for over a day in Paris , which was not our original destination.

**Around the last week of May to the first week of July, I will be flying to Korea.** 

**The current plan is from May 26 or 27 to July 6 or 7.** 

The dates are not a whole lot flexible. Especially coming back. As we have an infant and she's turning 2 on July 8, we don't want to pay thousands to get her a seat because she turned 2. Most airlines I searched charge 10% of the adult fare for a baby under 2. 

Our nearest airport is **Boise (1.5 hours) or Salt Lake City (2.5 hours)**

We are flying business class. 

**Currently what we have searched.** 

**Boise - Seattle - Seoul**

**Boise - Seattle (Alaska Airlines) - Economy Class**

**Seattle - Seoul (Asiana Airlines) - Business Class**

**This will be around $8,700**

**Boise - Seattle - Vancouver, BC - Seoul**

**Boise - Seattle (Alaska Airlines)  - Economy Class**

**Seattle - Vancouver (Delta) - Economy Class**

**Vancouver - Seoul (Korean Air) - Prestige Class**

Now, Vancouver - Seoul on Korean Air is substantially cheaper. Around $6200 for a round trip, while Boise - Vancouver or SLC - Vancouver is expensive, nearly $2000 just for that and I don't know if Delta charges on lap infant for that short flight to Canada. 

I've considered Boise - Seattle, which is only $380 for all of us then rent a car to drive across the border, drop the car off in Vancouver then fly out. This will cost us $800 for a rental car both ways in May and July. 

I am a US permanent resident and my wife and baby are US citizens. I don't know how complicated it is to get through immigration in YVR as I've only been to Vancouver by car before when I lived in Seattle. 

Or any other ideas are welcome. **The key is to keep it under 8,000 for everything and the long haul has to be business class but all domestic and SEA - YVR can be economy. Also worried about the luggage** as we will be carrying 2 suitcases under 50 lbs but most domestic airlines charge extra to make it more expensive than the flight tickets themselves."
Flights,"Flight got cancelled: What can I do?! So I've booked two flights for me and my GF from Zurich to Glasgow with a midway Stop at Frankfurt.

Flights go 12. August and back 26. August. The whole Trip is planned. 

On Sunday, 27th of August, we have a important Family gathering, we can absolutely not miss.

It was planned to fly back August 26. in the early afternoon, since we need to travel to Glasgow first. Now Lufthansa, the Airline we've booked the flight told us that the flight is cancelled and the only other Option would be 06.10 in the Morning.

After a DOZEN people in their Customer-Chat I had it happen twice that they've found an alternative but both times, I got kicked out of Chat. The other times they were just rude and not interested in helping. Now even on their Hotline they tell me: take the 06.10 flight or frick right off. 

Can I somehow demand a Refund of the flight back? With half the Money I spent for both flights, so 400 Euros, I could easily find a matching flight back. Or do I have other Options? We can't take a flight the next day or the day before. This would drastically increase our  costs. We've paid for everything and would need to change a lot.

Flights,"hacking the hidden city hack Not really a ""hack', but something that hadn't previously occurred to me.

Mexico City to New York City, one-way, in three weeks. Found a nonstop on Google Flights for US$254, booking directly with the airline. To Kiwi.com (for all its ills, a great search tool), which suggested a ""travel hack"": same flight to NYC, booked through to Chicago, for $180. Then to the airline's website, where it was $165.

The cons of throwaway ticketing: no checked bags, powerless if a connecting city changes, do it too often and airlines may reject future bookings or cancel points. Curious, I decided to input the same itinerary not as a one-way but ***as a multi-city booking***. Figured that way there is no checked luggage dilemma (although I travel with only an underseat backpack anyway), no risk of not reaching my intended destination, no comeback for skiplagging the second leg. At least, I think so?

As a multi-city, the price was still US$165. The flight I want – with a 35% saving and none of the downsides. Unsure if this is a happy anomaly or multi-city fares for any given itinerary are regularly priced the same as a one-way? Does anyone know?"

Flights,"Why are flights to Europe priced so well from LAX compared to most other major U.S. airports? You’d think they’d be the most expensive because of how much further it is. I’ve booked multiple flights from LAX to Europe, including to Vienna, Dublin, Barcelona, Madrid, etc. throughout the past year or two— and each time I’ve purchased the tickets, I’ve been shocked at how cheap the fares were.

In March I am going to Dublin and my ticket was like $700. My friend from Austin is trying to join me on the trip, but the flights are easily $1,500 minimum. I looked from AUS, DFW, IAH, ORD, EWR, JFK, BOS, PHL, IAD, etc. and LAX has way cheaper options than all of those. 

This has been the case with almost every other time that I have purchased tickets to Europe. 

You’d think LA would generally be the most expensive US city to fly to Europe from because it’s the farthest major city away from the continent.  

Why is this? 

Is it because there is so much international flight/airline competition at LAX that the fares stay low? 

Is it a lack of demand? Tbh I doubt that this is the case because there are still SO many nonstop flights from LAX to Europe, so if there really was a lack in demand, then you’d think some airlines would just discontinue flying these routes altogether."

So, I’ve just booked a flight with the website Netflights. My flight is actually with Finnair, operated by American Airlines and booked through Netflights (a little confusing, I would have loved to just go direct with an airlines but I cannot afford it at the moment). 

Anyway, I booked the flight. I inputted all the information correctly - I am positive about this as all my invoice and confirmation and even the passenger information on my ticket email from Netflights has my name in the correct order of Miss First Name Middle Name Last Name. 

I’ve gone onto the American Airlines app to add my flight and see the ticket, also the VeriFLY app and Netflights have sent my name through to them incorrectly. They have sent it through as First Name-miss Last Name (For example if my name was Alice Snow, they have put “Alicemiss Snow”.

I’m very worried about this as I’m concerned if my boarding pass does not match my passport I will not be able to fly. I’ve googled the forums on Netflights and it has mentioned that you might have to cancel the ticket in full, with no refund and book again. Or pay a fee to change the name. Some others spoke about how they misspelt their name and had to pay to change it. If I had actually inputted my name wrong and misspelt it then I agree it would be on me, however I am certain I inputted the information right, there is absolutely no way I’d put miss on the end of my name and the fact it’s all correct on the Netflights confirmation emails shows this too. I haven’t spoken to the company yet as their lines aren’t open, I’m just apprehensive on what they will respond and that they will try to blame me.

No specific itinerary as this is something that I search for frequently in various routes. For example, from Europe to the US, with the one-stop stopover being in the US. Between the European city and the first US city is a much longer flight, so I want business. But it's only a 2-3 hour flight between the stopover city in the US and my final destination in the US, so I don't care about needing business and prefer to save money by booking economy or premium economy for that leg.

The suggested change was to be routed through San Salvador at a completely different departure time so I picked up the phone. 

Called up and asked to amend the ticket so that the final and only destination is BOG and was told that it was not possible and that I needed to fly inwards through to either Barranquilla or Cartagena.

Have been getting run-around by both Expedia agents and KA agents about advance seat for many months. Expedia agents attempted to book seats for us, but seats were never update on KA website. Spoke to KA agent, they said Class T, cheap fare ticket, required additional payment for advance seat selection otherwise seat will be randomly select for us at the gate. Is this the new policy?

Random seat will not works with us as we are flying with todler/infant. We do not want to gamble with our seat at the gate. Paying for advanced ticket will cost us $900-$1,100 additional for 5 seats on top of the already paid tickets. What can we do at this point?

I read about a post of some workaround to selecting seat. Going to atempt it but wonder if anyone else has a better solution.

&gt; link:[https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-air-lines-skymiles/1933280-choosing-seats-ke-2.html](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/delta-air-lines-skymiles/1933280-choosing-seats-ke-2.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;The situation is frustrating. Being SIN based and having flown KE several times on TPAC flights in the last year, my current strategy is this:  
1. Once ticketed and you have the KE PNR, you can usually log in to select your seats on KE's website. Note that once you've done this once, you won't be able to do it again.  
2. If you are unable to select (or change) a seat, create a Korean SkyPass profile for yourself and add the reservation to it. From that point forward, if you log in to manage your booking through your profile, you can see and change seat assignments.  
3. At check-in window open or any time thereafter, you can log on again and begin process to finalise your seat preference.  
4. Before finalising check-in, call Korean to re-update your frequent flyer number to DL (assuming you have status to be recognised and / or want to earn to DL account). Unfortunately this cannot be done online before or at check-in.  
5. Return to check-in and complete process. (You won't be able to change seat again once your DL number has been re-added.)  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The above is certainly needlessly clunky and time-consuming, but is a workable fix until this is addressed.  
A few other notes:  
\- As noted by others, forward economy cabin is blocked until check in (or a few days before), but I've always seen plenty of good seats open at check-in.  
\- An award ticketed on DL and operated by KE seemed to allow me to reserve seats on DL's website, but didn't stick on KE, so take note of that.  
\- I've never been reassigned once choosing my seat (10-12 flights in the last year), so hopefully this isn't widespread.  
\- I've been greeted on every TPAC segment by FAs thanking me for flying with them."

I am thinking of flying with Lufthansa to Hungary departing on June 2nd and returning on June 25th. 

The costs however are insane. They are roughly $1800 with taxes when you include bag and seat selection. LOT is about the same when it comes to costs. 

Does anyone know of any upcoming sales or promo codes to cut the costs down?"
Flights,"Please help, cant get refund I have purchased flight tickets for holidays through Fourcorner travel agendcy. It was a donestic flight and I received a confirmation. About one month later I received an email from United that my tickets were canceled, they wouldnt explain why and wouldnt reschedule. I requested a refund from United Airlines however they said that I should rediredct my request to Korean Airlines as tickets were purchased through them. I have no idea why tickets went through KA as it was domestic flight. I contacted Korean Airlines but they refused any help because tickets were purchased by third party. Now fun part Fourcorner travel agency refunded 1/4 th of the money and when I asked about the remaining amount they dont have any answers. They say they requested money from United Airlines but wont provide any copies to me. They wont refund the money as „they dont have it”, they refuse any written communication saying „the supervisor will call you later” but he never does. I keep calling them and conversation goes in circles „we cant refund” „we dont have your money” „contact airlines” „I cant send you any emails, supervisor will call you later”. To be honest I am not sure what to do now, its been over three months and neither of three companies want to deal with me or refund the money. Please share any ideas what to do in this situation."

Yesterday, I was trying to fly from Alabama USA to Portugal yesterday and had several delays which resulted in me needing to stay overnight in New York. I missed a day of work.

Birmingham, AL  to ATL Georgia was delayed so I missed my ATL to JFK New York flight. 

My ATL to JFK flight was also delayed so I missed my JFK to Lisbon Portugal flight. 

Both flights I believe may have been due to weather ? I don’t really remember them saying that was the reason but I don’t think I can check? It was just raining slightly.

Anyways, DELTA gave me a hotel and 30 USD for food but to be honest, New York is expensive so that was enough for soup and a sandwich. I still needed to pay for more meals which i would not have bought otherwise.

Also I missed work in Portugal as well as I was supposed to arrive Friday at 8am but it seems I will arrive Saturday at 8am. 

Does this sound like something that would be worth paying for a compensation service? Or will it just be rejected due to weather claim."

I have planned a trip to Israel in early April and started booking flights. I have booked a flight to Istanbul, where my layover is and I wanted to buy a ticket for a second leg of my journey, which is from Istanbul to Tel Aviv.

In my plans, I wanted to book with Israir Airlines and went directly to their website (in English). My booking payment was refused. I retried and it failed again!

Then, I tried on their website in Hebrew and when I reached payment, it stated that only NIS (ILS) **credit cards** are accepted for payments and no debit cards are allowed. My card is debit and has euros, so I meet no requirement.

I started getting very nervous, because I already booked a portion of my journey. I would look for alternatives if I knew I cannot book a flight I want. Therefore now, I am wondering whether Israir Airlines is a reliable company. What are the chances of flights being cancelled? Or even company going under?

What are the risks of buying this ticket with agencies like kiwi.com, MyTrip or Opodo? I am very afraid that my flight or my ticket (if I buy via an agency) will be canceled for some reason. What do you suggest?"
Flights,"Japan Airlines flight schedule Hi all, bit of a doozy here so stay with me. 

My wife and I bought tickets to Japan for September, flying from Melbourne to Tokyo. We chose separate flights, on different days so we weren’t on the same flight. This was a stipulation from my wife in the unlikely event there was an issue with the flight and our two kids, left back in Melbourne weren’t left without parents. Macabre, I know, but anyway. 

JAL have now decided that they aren’t flying direct each day and have shifted my wife onto the same departing and return flight as me. Despite looking forward to a night at the beginning and end of our trip by myself in Tokyo, this has thrown out well intentioned plans out the window. 

I’m wondering if anyone knows whether this is a shifting sands situation and JAL will put those flights back on the schedule later in the year. Is it a final decision or do they do this routinely to try and deliver fuller flights? Seems strange to me that with Japan opening up again and it being a destination of choice that the daily flights would disappear all together. 

Anyway, any inside word or experience would be greatly appreciated.

Hey everyone, not sure if I should post here. Just needed some advice cause I’m at my wits end! Please let me know where to post if this is the wrong place but let me start. 

Kinda none important info, but I have had terrible mental health through my 20s. Uni was terrible, my first job broke me and by age 24 I was kicked out of my house by my mother. Living in a hostel for over two years, and was unemployed all that time. I worked really hard to build myself up and went back into work. 

I worked so hard to save up money for a ticket to my family in Zambia. (Birmingham, UK through Paris then Nairobi to Ndola Zambia). At that point I hadn’t seen them in seven years and I was over the moon to save up and book the tickets on the January of 2020 for June 2020 two weeks. 

Unfortunately, my tickets were cancelled in May of that year - after all we were in a Panasonic. I understood the cancellation and thought I was bummed out, I thought, I’d get my refund and save up again. The problem is, as time passed by and I messaged them on their website and through twitter they kept fobbing me off. 

The refund was taking longer to process because of covid. Basically they were telling me to leave them alone until there was a refund. Then eventually about a year later I messaged them again and they informed me that the carrier (airfrance) had taken over.

I was frustrated of course, these jackasses hadn’t even bothered to tell me that it was airfrance that I needed to contact. So if I hadn’t pushed for it, nothing would be done.

After this, I of course tried to reach out to airfrance to get my refund but they said - I booked it through an agency so the agency should be the ones to give me the refund. 

I went back and forth for weeks before just having to back away or having a melt down. I was also really wrapped up in trying to survive and work through the pancakey as an essential worker. 

Now in 2023, I message the website and their twitter for help - but no one responds. 

Do you guys have any advice? I work from pay check to pay check and struggle. Losing nearly £500 has been a gut punch that I can’t accept. I really need that money back - I really want to go back home and visit my family - especially the elders in my life who I worry I won’t be able to see again. Please, if you can, help."

However, I've noticed that this policy is inconsistent. I've seen many people having to pay extra when boarding as their hand luggage is bigger than the required size, but this seems to only apply to suitcases, I've flown many times with a rucksack much larger than the requirements (which definitely can't fit under the seat) and not been told anything even if I'm boarding just after someone who had to pay extra for the size of their luggage.

So my question is would it be considred as connecting flight and will my luggage be transferred in this case too? If not will I need a visa to go to arrivals and departures again? I saw that I dont need transit visa but I would need a visa if entering vietnam.

I would be travelling by vietjet air.

Flights,"Rules on laptops and turbulence Hello all! 

A fairly low-stakes question but one that's been annoying me a little bit since the weekend. I flew from Valencia to Gatwick with Vueling (VY8472 29/01/23 VLC-LGW) last week - bit of a miserable flight that dragged on to be honest. Absolutely packed, allocated a middle seat, and the cabin crew didn't come around with the refreshment trolley for some reason (they made an announcement about it but my Spanish isn't very good and I don't think it was repeated in English).

Anyway - we went through a few spells of slight turbulence around the Pyrenees. I always work on my laptop during these sorts of short haul flights (I quite like not having Wifi or distractions) but when the turbulence hit a member of cabin crew told me to put my laptop away. I thought I'd misunderstood her but she started gesturing and speaking in Spanish so of course I complied!

I've never known an airline do this before and I fly pretty regularly. Sure, for taxi, take-off, and landing but not for in-flight turbulence. So I suppose my question is, is Vueling being overzealous, or are all of the other airlines not being zealous enough? To what extent are these rules decided by the airline versus the ICAO?"

Priority boarding never happened and when I confronted the airline staff about it, they told me they had no idea what that was and told me to discuss it with Expedia. When I called Expedia, they told me to talk to the airline and basically refused to give me a refund for it. 

Not too long afer, I booked a round trip flight between NYC and Toronto. Since I wasn't sure I was gonna go to NYC or LA, I paid for the trip protection service that's supposed to cover trip cancellations or changes.

Flights,"WhicH US Airlines have truly fully refundable tickets? Just had a scare with American Airlines, I picked fully refundable and it said refundable on both Main Cabin and Main Cabin Plus (both by searching for Flexible Fares). However apparently the Main Cabin only gives a credit while the Main Cabin Plus ($3000 more) gives the option of the 'full refund.' It took 45 minutes on the phone to see this.

Flights,"Advice for dealing with lost luggage/trouble reporting? I am having the hardest time dealing with my luggage situation and am hoping someone has advice for me! This is long, please bear with me. 

I just traveled from Anchorage AK to Tromso Norway. This took 4 flights among 3 airlines

Anchorage to Seattle - Alaska Air
Seattle to Reykjavik- Icelandair
Reykjavik to Oslo- Icelandair
Oslo to Tromso- SAS

So, I originally checked my bag with Alaska, so I have that bag tag number. My flight getting into Reykjavik was very delayed and I missed my connection. So, I stayed overnight there with a hotel voucher from Icelandair. They asked if I wanted to retrieve my checked bag and I said yes. However, the woman at baggage services said it did not appear it made it on the plane in Seattle. She told me to report it missing when I got to my final destination, Tromso. 

The next day I fly to Oslo, and it is required you get your checked bag and re-check in for the next domestic flight. I was optimistic that maybe my bag had found it’s way, so I waited. Turns out that they were having an issue opening a compartment door on the plane and couldn’t get our bags out. The woman at this baggage service desk told me and others to continue to our flight to Tromso and again, file a report when we got to Tromso. She handed out a paper with a QR code to use the SAS online report tool. 

As expected, there’s no bag when I get to Tromso. I didn’t see a baggage service desk so opted for the online tool and left for my hotel. However, the tool gives me an error when I enter my bag tag number and says it cannot be validated. 

I have contacted all three airlines multiple times:
Alaska Air says it shows the last scan at TSA in Anchorage. They do not have any records of them holding it. They suggested I  talk with Iceland Air out of Seattle and SAS as my final carrier. 

Icelandair wasn’t helpful at all - they said there’s nothing they can do and I have to report through SAS. 

SAS says they use the same system as the online tool so they cannot create a report and generate a PIR. 

Tomorrow I am going to call the Oslo baggage services to see if I can make headway there (per SAS recommendations). In the meantime, is there anything else I should do? Anywhere else to try to contact? Any idea on where this all went so wrong?

Having a missing bag is stressful enough but I am exasperated by not being able to even report it!"

I’m not one for looking to material shit to bring me joy but there is something I love about being able to wear these shoes now. To all the poor kids out there... keep grinding. It’s gonna be harder for you. But you already know that. Now go get it. And always remember that THE STUPID SNEAKERS MEAN NOTHING. They’re a bunch of overpriced cotton and plastic stitched together and marketed as a symbol of status. That FEELING you get when you know you earned whatever it is you choose to spend your money on - that’s what’s real. That means something. The rest is just bullshit.

I moved away from home living paycheck-to-paycheck so being able to buy this level of comfort definitely gives me that FEELING of earning something he's talking about!"

So 2 days ago United cancelled my return flight 2 months before the trip (without notification, I only caught it because I check my ticket multiple times a day bc I’m so paranoid lol) 
They offered a refund or to change my flight so I opted out for the latter. My friend who I am going with had the same tickets so she contacted United to see if we could fly from another airport. Our original return flight was KIX-SFO, SFO-LAX. The United agent managed to change and book our return flight from ITM-HND, HND-LAX for us. Only problem is that the connecting flight ITM-HND is through ANA and not United but the flight from HND-LAX is through United. The departing flight and all flights through United have my name written correctly, and when I search the reservation it is correct with my name. However when I check the ANA flight my name is input wrong when I search the reservation I have to input my full first name with my first initial of my middle name, which I don’t have to do for my United flight. For example, imagine my name is “Jessica Rene Arthur” (fake name). When I search my reservation through United I can search “Jessica Arthur” and it will find the reservation. When I search for the reservation for the ANA flight i can only find it if I search “Jessicar Arthur”. I don’t want them to think that my middle name initial is the last letter to my first name. I hope this makes sense. I don’t want to be stuck because it doesn’t match my passport. 
I contacted a United agent last night to get it fixed and they said it was fixed and I asked them to send a confirmation email with the changes, but I have not received any email and the search results are still under “Jessicar Arthur”. Should I contact United again? I also don’t want to have to pay because they made the mistake. Thank you in advance!"

Does it matter if I purchase the ticket from a flight engine like Expedia, an aggregator, or directly from the airline company?

For example, I can't find if there is a full refund if cancel a one way international flight with Japan airline  in 24 hours.

Flights,"Airplane Ticket Japan Adivce Hello everyone, as the title say, in need some advice for buying ticket

We are from Italy, Milan, and we are planning to visit Japan for 3 weeks this Summer, from 5/08 to 26/08, but the main problem right now is the cost of the flights...right now is above 1300€ we was hoping to get it around 1000€

What did you think? The date are form 5/08 to 26/08 and i searched on Skyscanner... In the past weeks for a short period, was on 950€ but we didnt buy it in time and it jumped at 1100€, so we waited...and now its raising...and we dont know if we could wait and pray for a lower price, or just buy it now and cry for the missed opportunity...

We was planning to buy it as soon as we can so we could also reserve some hotel/Airbnb for the trip...what do you guys think? We could wait or we should buy it now? (Sorry for the bad english, i hope Is good enought to understand)"

Made a booking to travel to the United States from Europe with Icelandair and realized one of the passenger's first name was spelled slightly incorrect. The correct given names according to the passport are spelled in this example ""Da Da"".

I am not using the real name in this example for obvious reasons. I realized that I had entered the given names incorrectly at the website by spelling it ""Dada"" and missing the space between the names.

I contacted Icelandair and they said that they couldn't change it due to limitations in their system but I was told that this shouldn't a problem. At the same time there was no guarantee that we wouldn't have issues at check-in at the departure airport.

We have the correct given names in the APIS and in the approved ESTA application as well. 

Has anybody encountered this situation before and had issues with traveling? This shouldn't be a problem right? I am just overly worried about this being a potential problem but at the same time the US is very strict when it comes to these things.

Flights,"Toddler being assigned different rows than parent on flights This has happened to me several times. I buy two tickets together and don’t pay to choose my seats when booking. The airline then automatically assigns seats for me and my travel companion, who happens to be two years old. We check in and I notice that our seats are in different rows. Sometimes they can change it at the counter, other times they tell me to board and ask the flight crew if they can help. The last flight I was on, I had a middle seat and my son had a middle seat behind me, and the people in window and aisle seats did not want to move. Finally two other people volunteered to trade. It was all very awkward.

I got my flights cancelled three months ahead - was going to fly from Prague to Bari in April with WizzAir.

WizzAir does not offer refunds - you have to first ask for refund in the form of Wizz credits, THEN you can ask to convert abovementioned credits to cash. It's the only way, or at least that's what they mention on their website.

It has been 27 days. Haven't seen a penny. Yet again in their website they mention that the conversion is completed up until 7 days after the request and I even received an invoice via mail.

Need a bit of advice or more like reassurance on my recently purchased tickets to Bangkok. 

I've purchased flight tickets via kiwi.com, (first time ever doing so) and have some doubts.

I'm flying Vilnius to Frankfurt on Feb 19th, (arrival 16:35), have a very narrow layover (1h15min) to Viena, departing at 17:50, arriving 19:15, and have another narrow layover of only 1h, for flight to Bangkok which departs at 20:15. 

I don't have any checked baggage, ao that saves me time. Though, if no delays, should I be worried? If there are delays, it's likely that kiwi won't give a damn and I will need to book new flights myself? (no compensation and etc.) Do I need some additional protection/insurance for that?

I booked an international flight for United through Expedia and later found out I need to stay home to take care of some personal matters. However it wasn't anything related to family illness or death so a refund wasn't allowed. I contacted Expedia via chat and they said it was possible for me to change the booking to a later date which was great

I gave the rep a date range for the depart and return dates but he said they're not allowed to change the booking to a lower class flight (understandable they don't want to pay you back for switching). However I found other flights that were of the exact same airlines and exact same class ""premium economy"". The guy responded that it would cost upwards if 3400 dollars which is ridiculous... I might as well just buy a whole new ticket at that point and not bother using the flight rebook option. He then said this is because with in each flight class economy, premium economy, etc there are muitple subclasses and I can only choose ones that are equal to or higher class than my current flight. We spent an hour on chat plugging in different date ranges to find a good arrangement but most of them included me having to pay out a difference of 3000+ dollars.

The guy then gave up and said I may have to check in later when it approaches my actual flight to see if there are better options available where I wouldn't have to pay a boat load of money to rebook. Anyone had any luck changing their flights at all through Expedia? Should I just give 80 hope at this point?"

I would like some clarification on EU261 passenger claim for flight disruptions.

My flight itinerary was as follows:

Flight 2: Helsinki to New York with Finnair

Flight 3: New York to Destination with American Airlines as part of Finnair Alliance.

All flights booked as part of 1 itinerary and with Finnair directly.

Flight 2 from Helsinki was delayed by 1hr+, causing me to miss onward connection (i.e. Flight 3) and arrive at destination well over 12 hrs later. No extenuating circumstances. Flight history of that flight illustrates it routinely arrives 1hr + late and the connection would have been tight even if the flight was to arrive on time - to be quite honest.

Flights,"We got wrecked in the grey space Three of us were planning on going to Disneyland in November of 2022, from Alberta Canada. We showed up that morning to the flight, very excited and eager to get to Disneyland for my first time. 

Upon arrival there was a quite a long line in what seemed like a very empty airport (4 am) The flight had been canceled due to not having a plane or pilot at the airport. They claimed that under weather conditions the flight could not progress. 

We got some of our money back because the airport company canceled on our vacation package without proper warning, but only flights and bags 1950$. Not hotel, park tickets, shuttle 3400$

The cancellation, trip interruption and covid19 insurance coverage package that we purchased through the airline vacation package, did not cover ""day of"" departure interruptions or cancellations (that blows my mind). It covers day before cancellations. And it covers after you flown any interruptions past that. Due to a word technicality the claim has been denied

We will not be refunded any of the $3400 we spent on a vacation package because technically it was canceled the day of departure. 

This feels like a reach, but it only seems like the right place to ask. Is there any way I can get this money back? Is there any solution to this problem? 

There's a small bit of information that is potentially available but we have no actual availability in getting (an email). But some people didn't show up that morning because they had an email sent to them saying that the flight had been canceled the night before. We called the airport company and they declared that the flight had been canceled 3 hours after it was supposed to leave. But why would they send out an email to people the night before if it hadn't already been known of to be canceled? We did not receive this email, quite a few other people did not receive this email, only a few people got the email... I need to know that it was canceled before the day of departure so I can get my money back via insurance.

Outside of that we're screwed for getting our money back. I really fucking hate these airline companies that make you fight for your money."

My problem is that that BA flight from Heathrow to Doha on flight stats is being delayed considerably every day by at least one hour maybe even more (this week one delay was nearly 6 hours). 

This obviously has me quite worried about the high chance of missing that connecting flight as the flight always arrives very late (not making up the time en route), and thereby losing my hotel booking in Saigon and even potentially my ability to enter Vietnam as Qatar only flies once to Saigon daily and Vietnam visas require an entry date.

My question is - I see Qatar Airways has a codeshare with BA flight leaving about 40 minutes earlier from Heathrow each day, and seems to be leaving relatively on time and always arrives on Doha earlier than its schedule even when delayed a bit. Do you think if I ring BA and explained my situation they'd be able to book me on that earlier flight?

I got an agency organize the flights for my trip to Bali and I have to change flight in Singapore. The flight I have to take from Singapore is intercontinental and departure is at 11.30pm , but I will arrive at the airport from Bali at 10.40pm, hence having a little less than one hour to make the change and I know Singapore airport is huge.

Flights,"Transferring LCY-LHR I’m looking to book BER-SEA and the cheapest option for my dates by far involves transferring from LCY to LHR. The connection is 7 hours so more than enough time, even with checked luggage, and I’m very familiar with London so wouldn’t have any issues with the DLR/tube connection. It’s all one ticket so I know if the inbound BER-LCY is exceptionally delayed and I miss the next flight, BA will take care of me. 

My question is what happens if I miss the connection due to factors outside of BA’s control? I’m talking about severe train delays/cancellations etc. I know it’s unlikely, as 7 hours is more than double BA’s MCT for LCY-LHR, but there’s always a possibility that a short flight delay on top of delayed trains on top of crowds at Heathrow departures could snowball and lead to me missing the connection and I wondered how BA would approach this."

So I'm looking to book a round trip ticket at the end of march (26th ish give or take a day) to the 4th of April (give or take a day). The flight is from Missoula (or Spokane, but peferably Missoula) to Tulsa and back.

When I looked online, they said to book domestic flights a month in advance, but tickets were \~$400 4 months in advance and they are now \~$550. Should I just bite the bullet and book it now or wait until closer to the date to book it?

Not looking for professional advice and I know its not an exact science so its okay if I make the wrong decision. Just want to hear other people's opinions.

Flights,"SQ quality downgrade Recently flew from Singapore to Seoul with Singapore Airlines economy. This was my first trip since Covid. Realized they’ve downgraded almost everything. First were the seats. They’re using budget airline seats. Sure they still had the entertainment system but the seats were thinner and felt uncomfortable. Much narrower and less leg room. They also didn’t give out hot towels anymore. Finally, they only gave one meal for the whole flight. I believe they usually give out 2 and a snack but they only gave out 1. I understand if they’re trying to make more profits since Covid screwed them over, but I thought that was what the price gouging was for. Anyone had the same experience?"

Flights,"Curious about what happened on my flight from Schiphol Airport (Amsterdam) to JFK (NYC) recently I’m from NYC (US citizen) and recently went on a work trip to Cape Town, South Africa. On the way home (Jan 16), we flew KLM. I was with 2 other coworkers and we were all seated in different rows of business class. We split the trip up and had a short layover in Amsterdam before arriving at our final destination of JFK (flights DL9436 and DL9348).  


About 20 minutes after sitting down and getting settled in, the pilot came on the intercom. He said there was a slight problem, but we should be taking off shortly. Next thing I knew, a flight attendant was standing next to me asking to verify my identity. I confirmed and she told me to gather all of my belongings and come with her.  


Everyone around me was confused, including me. Everyone has seen people be pulled aside going through security before, but no one had seen someone pulled off a plane. My coworkers were worried the flight would take off without me and the flight attendant couldn't tell them that it wouldn't. She just repeated that I needed to make sure I didn't leave anything behind. The flight attendant escorted me off the plane, back through the jet bridge, and to a security area. There, a few people told me to take off my shoes. They searched through my bag thoroughly, put strips of paper of my hands/forehead/waist, and waved a wand over me (I’m guessing a metal detector?). They rechecked my ticket and passport. The only thing said was, “She’s coming from Africa.” Eventually they said I could board the plane again.  


After sitting down again, the pilot came on and said there was a missing passenger who never showed up, but his bags were on the plane. He said once his bags were located and removed, we’d be taking off. A few minutes later, we did.  


Upon arriving at JFK, I was one of the first passengers off the plane because my seat was near the doors. A police officer was standing on the jet bridge and he told the flight attendant he was looking for someone. I wish I could remember the name of the passenger he said he was looking for.  


I have no idea if the cop and missing passenger are related to why I was taken off the plane briefly, but I thought I’d include those details just incase. It really doesn’t matter at all haha but my coworkers and I are really curious why that happened.  


Any ideas? Is that normal practice in Amsterdam? Or do I just give off smuggler vibes or something??"

The Saudia plane (SV 899) made an unplanned stop in Riyadh with a delay of 2 hours, resulting in missing our connecting flight from Jeddah to Geneva on SV237.

We were told by the Saudia employee that our baggage checked in ICN will be delivered directly to Geneva. So after the extension of the trip to Incheon --&gt; Riyadh --&gt; Jeddah --&gt; Paris --&gt; Geneva, with only the final leg of the flight being changed now to Air France.

After all the runabout and no explanation nor apology, the luggage never arrived in Geneva. All of us passengers from this flight from Seoul to Geneva waited for hours, and nothing came. Meanwhile, the Geneva airport was about to close, the only person who was available for any help was the Air France employee who managed to track down luggage of one of the passengers, which was apparently still in Jeddah. So it was most likely that the luggage never got in the Saudia flight from Jeddah to Paris SV127. That was all he could tell us, and we all had to leave the airport.

This was last night. It's the next afternoon, and I've been desperately trying to get in touch with anyone from Saudia and all I get are call center employees saying that they have no way of tracking our luggage and suggesting that I contact the other airline. I've followed the protocol outlined on their website, filing claims with both Saudia and Air France, and it seems that neither are feeling responsible, and both are unwilling to help. Has anyone experienced something similar before and can shine some light on what I can do? Many of us are travelling to visit family for the long weekend, so our baggage contains all of our basic essentials.

For personal reasons I have had to travel to India, and therefore I will be missing the first leg of the return trip I booked. I am making my way to Japan from India and still require the return journey from Tokyo to Heathrow. 

I have been notified by TravelUp that if I miss the outbound flight the return flight will be automatically cancelled by BA’s systems, meaning I’d be unable to claim a refund and I’d have to book an additional one way journey from Tokyo to London. 

This is obviously going to get very expensive, is there anything I can do to avoid my return leg getting cancelled? Can I have the price of my current trip credited against a new return trip?

If anyone has any knowledge or has experienced this before I’d be very grateful, thank you!"

Flights,"Swiss compensation claim denied Dear Redditors, just got denied a cancelled/delayed compensation claim by Swiss Airlines. What happened was the flight was cancelled after we were boarded, the pilot said technical problem. Got rebooked for the next day, taken to a hotel. We were told to take a cab to the airport next day and to file a claim with Swiss. 
In the end we got home the next day, 30 hours late. Also it hapened to be New Year's Eve, but we did manage to get home about an hour before midnight.

Today I got a denial stating as follows: Your flight LX2111 on 30 December 2022 unfortunately had to be canceled due to an unexpected flight safety shortcoming. On behalf of SWISS and its cooperation partners, I apologize for the inconvenience you had as a result.
The aircraft scheduled to operate the rotation had a uncontrolled loss of bleed air.
Safety is SWISS first priority. We consider the described flight cancelation necessary and the irregularity to be extraordinary circumstances. These could not have been avoided even if all reasonable measures had been taken. Therefore, I must deny your claim for compensation under regulation EU261/2004. 

Not only did they deny compensation, but there is no mention of my cab fare either!

Does anyone have any advice? I mean, idk what an uncontrolled loss of bleed air is and whether that is an extraordinary circumstance? 

Thank you!"
Flights,"Lufthansa Flight Delay Compensation? Awful Lufthansa Experience

I was on a Lufthansa Flight from Athens to Frankfurt back in October. The flight was delayed by 90 minutes which caused me to miss my connecting flight back to the United States.

I had to stay overnight at a hotel (that Lufthansa paid for), however this delayed my return by a full day.

I filled out the request for compensation and was offered 600 EUR per passenger. I accepted the offer and sent in my passport and banking details. A few weeks went by and I heard nothing.

They eventually reached back out and told me that United is responsible for compensating me which I found puzzling as the delay was caused by Lufthansa. I reached out to United and they said the following: “United and its Star Alliance partners handle complaints on each other's behalf, based on the issue and the itinerary. However, some cases like yours may involve regulatory issues, so the operating carrier wants to handle them in-house. By contractual agreement, our partners expect this courtesy of us, and they reciprocate when a similar case involves a United-operated flight; this allows each carrier to ensure its own adherence to certain regulations. Although we can't predict another carrier's response to specific complaints, I hope this will give you confidence that it's not our intention to avoid handling your claim, but to help you seek resolution from the responsible party.”

I am not sure what to do next. There is no customer service line that someone can help me with and I am pretty sure they legally owe me money for the Delay. Any advice on how to handle this? I have filled out the feedback form almost daily and nobody is responding."

Last transatlantic flight I did, it occurred to me that if I waited until the very end to board the plane (literally the last passenger) I could survey the whole aircraft of empty seats as I proceed down the aisle, and quickly take one of them for myself rather than waiting til we are in the air and the seat belt sign goes off and there's a mini scramble for whatever is available.

Flights,"Do local authorities subsidise flights to their areas to bring in business? I have heard that part of the reason airlines like Ryanair have flights so cheap is that the local authority will subsidise the cost of tickets in order to bring tourists to the area who will spend money and boost the economy.

I have done a quick Google and seen that this has happened for expensive destinations, but I am wondering if this is quite a common thing?

I have personally taken a £10 flight from the UK to Germany and Ryanair had flights advertised for £5.

I'm aware of other airline tactics to make money, e.g. charging for baggage and all the other add-ons, but I am wondering whether the subsidised ticket prices is a common thing. I'm aware some airlines/geographies don't pay tax or aeroplane fuel etc. which will also bring the price down, but some of the ticket prices they are offering I believe would otherwise be below cost."

The agent informed me that I cannot cancel the ticket but due to pandemic they have revised the ticket validity is for 3 years so I have till Nov 2024 to utilize the ticket which was justified. 
On Nov 2022 when I called in to rebook ticket, the agent informed me that my ticket is cancelled as it was valid for one year only and if I had some issues I should send the feedback informing about the previous conversation.
They responded that it is only valid for one year and I will not get extension unless I prove them with the conversation indicating  the 3 years validity. Like time of call etc which obviously I cannot keep as it was a year ago.
Any suggestions whom to contact in this regard since the ticket was around $8000 I do not want to waste my money.

Flights,"Qantas put me on a different flight without informing me My partner and I are scheduled to fly Rapid City - Dallas, USA on the 19th January with American Airlines, before making the remainder of our journey home to Australia with QANTAS.

 We booked on seperate tickets (big mistake, I know) through a travel agency, this case being Webjet.  

We were checking the Qantas app last night to ensure everything was squared away, and noticed that my American Airlines flight out of Rapid had been changed to an earlier flight. My partners booking remained untouch, as did our international flight back home.

According to Webjet, I am still booked for the flight I originally booked. Same deal with American Airlines. It is only QANTAS who is telling me different.

So I contacted Webjet looking for answers. They don't have a number to call from overseas, so my only option was the online chat. It took 3 hours for Webjet support to tell me something close to the effect of ""QANTAS has initiated a major schedule change"", and that's the reason I was moved to another flight.  Like I said though, my partners flight, however, was unchanged.

So if there was a so-called 'major schedule change', then why is my partner still on the same flight? And I checked, this flight, which had been supposedly been affected by said changes, still has 2 seats available. It just makes no sense why they would move me.

Webjet then claimed that they had emailed me on QANTAS behalf, asking if this change would be acceptable, but as they didn't recieve a response from me, they took it as a yes and subsequently moved me over.

Now I constantly check my emails, even to the point it is almost obsessive, and I know 100% I was not informed of such a change, nor did anyone ask permission to change my flight. They weren't able to provide any date or proof of said email being sent to me.

And so what if they did email me, what gives them the right to make changes to a customer's flight I specifically booked and paid for? Seriously. A lack of response should NOT give them the right to change this. People are on holidays, could be camping etc with no reception, shouldn't have to put up with this rubbish.

Webjet them also says they will contact QANTAS to TRY and change me back to my original flight. I contacted QANTAS direct who told me that Webjet would need to contact them directly in order to put me back on my original flight. I find it absolutely ridiculous that QANTAS can kick me off my flight willy-nilly but can't make it right without further steps.

Our journey here was just as, if not more stress inducing. This is a story for another time, but my partners connecting flight to Sydney was delayed, which caused her to miss our international flight to Dallas. So while I flew to Dallas and onto Rapid City without her, she got flung to Honolulu, then Chicago. THEN, when they got up in the air from Chicago, the nose landing gear wouldn't go down (it was only a sensor issue, unbeknownst at the time), which got treated as an emergency landing.
She ended up making it to Rapid City a day later.

So you can understand why we do not want to go on seperate connecting flights.

I will update here if/when this is remedied.

Two very valuable lessons this has taught me:

1) Never book with family/friends on seperate tickets, if you don't want to be seperated.

And 2) Never book with a travel agent.
Travel agency websites are only useful for comparing flights. You do not save any money booking this way, and it will just cause you headaches when there's an issue.

Take it from me."

Virgin said AC could call and make the change, but they refused. AC said I could cancel and rebook (for a fee of course). But the AC rep said not to worry about it &amp; that the carrier that mentioned my whole name must match would use common sense.

So, my question how much discount does ANA sky coins give for a flight that's costs £3,800 if I have 80,000 Sky coins?

I couldn't find anywhere online on how much sky coins are worth.

&gt;Electronics and lithium batteries  
&gt;  
&gt;You’re allowed to bring 15 electronic devices with a lithium battery up to 100 Wh, and 20 spare lithium batteries or power banks up to 100 Wh. If you want to bring a lithium battery up to 160 Wh with you in your hand baggage, either in a device or as a spare, you need to request permission. Batteries larger than 160 Wh are never allowed. Devices and batteries should not be damaged, defective, or recalled.

I wish it was written like a legal document. If it was me I would've written the policy in one of two ways:

1. ""You're allowed to bring 15 electronic devices with a lithium battery, each up to 100 Wh"".
2. ""You're allowed to bring 15 electronic devices with a lithium battery, combined up to 100 Wh."".

Anyway. So I contacted customer support, and the person on the other end said that nr. 2 is true. And if I'd exceed capacity, that the excess would need to go into checked luggage.

Not only is it IMPOSSIBLE to make a booking using a non-indian card (i've tried - website tells you to use the app, the app ""books"" it but can't process the charge.) I read here that you can pay if you call them - so I call them, and the automated person on the phone is the worst fucking thing in the world. There's no way to skip or press buttons to advance, she doesn't understand you, repeats asking about bagging or whether you can take your laptop on the plane about four times, begins the process again, and then you get to the speak to the people. I tell them I want to make a payment for my flight, they ask for my confirmatioon number and then proceed to ask ME what my flight date is, departure time is, phone number, and cost of the flight. And then they finally transfer me to billing, only to come back 2 minutes later saying they're busy, and they'll call you back.

If you don't have the ticket paid for in 30 minutes, it cancels itself and you have to start over. It takes AT LEAST 15 minutes to get someone on the line, and then you have to go through the exact same process again. Except this time I tell them I just want to pay at the airport. Then they tell me it's impossible to do that, so I say OK I want to pay for my flight and they tell me no sir, because the card is showing an error there's nothing they can do.

I'm flying with baggage so booking through Indigo vs a travel website saves me at least 5000 INR before I even factor in all the other benefits (early checkin, free seating, etc) so now they tell me I can book the ticket at the airport, but that I can only do it UP UNTIL three hours before the flight. The flight leaves at 7:25, the airport is an absolutely tiny regional airport, and they now want me to be there at 4:30 in the morning to book my flight because if I arrive after 2h30m then I won't be able to book it there.

2. KLM 877 (AMS to BOM) Usually departs AMS from E or F gates

Flights,"Small Claims Court is Great for Air Travel Disputes Hi everyone, recently I flew Turkish to Ethiopia. It was a terrible flight experience to a beautiful country but I wanted to give advice to anyone else who might have been screwed by an airline. You can see my other posts here and here

https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/101ywvn/i_flew_turkish_but_they_cancelled_my/

https://www.reddit.com/r/Flights/comments/yw3saq/turkish_airlines_cancelled_my_connecting_flight/

To summarize, Turkish cancelled the second leg of my outbound flight and put me on an Ethiopian airlines flight instead some hours later after a lot of fighting. Ethiopian lost my carry on that they forced me to stow, which contained a brand new suit I was planning to wear to my friend's wedding. It never arrived while I was in Ethiopia. While in Ethiopia, Turkish cancelled my return flight the day I was meant to return and I just chose to fly back on United since Turkish had been so terrible. 

Once I got back to the USA, I tried to get my money back for the cancelled flight from Turkish and also tried to get Ethiopian to reimburse me for the luggage they lost. Turkish refused and Ethiopian just didn't respond to my emails and calls. I did a charge back for the cancelled flight through my credit card, but they owed me more based on Turkish law. They would not give me that. 

Eventually I got fed up and went to small claims court on 12/22 instead, suing Ethiopian for $1200 and Turkish for 600 Euro. It takes about 2 weeks for summons to be delivered to the party that's being sued, but as of today, my luggage was hand delivered to my house and Turkish has credited my card. 

Funny enough, Turkish tried only offering me 30k points at first, then followed up with another offer which I've attached here.

Flights,"Confusion about Flair refund/compensation I booked a flight with Flair last year and was notified of a flight change a few hours before we were supposed to arrive at the airport. The new flight itinerary was 7 days later. The reason provided in the email was ""controllable late arrival of aircraft caused by late boarding at previous station"".

After we got to the airport to try and figure something out, we received another email about one-and-a-half hours later stating that instead of being ""delayed"", the original flight was cancelled due to a ""controllable late arrival from previous station caused by an operational delay"" (so wording was slightly different from the initial reason). The rescheduled flight was again departing in 7 days but at a different time.

Of course this didn't work for us so we booked a flight with WestJet that was leaving in the next few hours. The email from Flair stated that if the rebooking didn't meet our needs, we could be entitled to a refund but we would NOT be entitled to compensation if we chose to book with another airline.

I thought that Flair would have to compensate us since their rebooked flight was way past 48 hours. Would the best next steps for me be to contact Flair directly asking for full compensation? They said they could provide a full refund for the flight but we had to spend a lot more money for the same-day flight with another airline so we would like compensation.

NOTE: Flair emailed us meal vouchers and the email said they would provide accommodations depending on availability. We did not use the meal vouchers or contact Flair regarding hotel bookings. We tried to call them to figure something out regarding getting an earlier flight but their service rep couldn't help and the desk agent at the airport couldn't do anything either.

Flights,"Emailed to call back lufthansa and told I need to re-book my ticket and extra bag and lose business class upgrades Title says most of it pretty much.  I got an email from Lufthansa with my full itinerary and a subject line ""Please call back your Lufthansa service center"".  So I call back and am told ""we will need to re-process your ticket"".  Ok, no problem.  The first phone agent I spoke to seemed out of it and acted like I was ""a normal economy passenger"" until I asked him repeatedly to look up the ticket which had upgrades attached to it.  At that point he said ""oh ok, yes so you will need to book this again, so can we proceed with the re-booking of your ticket and extra bag?""  I said I'd call back in hopes to get someone who seemed more with it.

So I called back and was put on hold a few times and the calls got dropped.  Finally after reaching through, I managed to ""re-book"" the ticket with the help of the agent.  The service agent mentioned she'd help me re-book my ticket and extra bag, but I'd have to re-book business class upgrades separately.  Ok, no problem at this point I just want to make sure I'm going to be on the plane.  But that was 3 days ago and I haven't seen any further email correspondence, no activity on the card I used to book the ticket, and no changes to my booking on the Lufthansa website or app.  So now I'm wondering how long any of this will take to show up and pretty sure that when it finally processes, the cost of a business class upgrade is going to be double or triple what I originally paid.

BA flight was delayed 75 mins, but due to arriving 50 minutes late and then baggage taking like 35 mins to arrive, we missed our connecting flight (same BA ticket but operated by Alaska). It was the last flight of the night so we had to spend the night in a hotel and catch another flight out the following day.

Am I within my rights to submit a claim for compensation and expenses? It seems like the wording is pretty clear: 

&gt; ""If you're delayed at your final destination by more than 3 hours and that delay arises from causes within our control...""

but I just wanted to check as the delay was only 1 hour but this caused us to arrive home more than 3 hours late. 

It also says:

&gt; ""250 EUR for flights of up to 1,500km, 
400 EUR for flights within the EU of more than 1,500km, and for all other flights between 1,500km and 3,500km, 
600 EUR for all other flights""

London &gt; Las Vegas is 8,393km so can I assume we can claim for the full 600EUR amount?

And finally, can I assume my wife and I (who were on the same booking) can claim this 600EUR compensation EACH? In addition to our hotel/taxi/food charges incurred?"

As I was talking to a representative he told me that since is international, I have to cancel within 24hrs from purchase, 7 days prior to the flight, and have not submitted any kind of documents for check in. I meet 2 out of 3, but still refuses to do the refund, I thought about changing the dates to spring break to bring my wife with me, but it would be cheaper for me to buy 3 tickets with a different airline, rather than changing my dates with Volaris. A friend recommended me to call my bank and claim the purchase was fradulent, but is been almost 2 months since I bought them, and the tickets are on my name, would I get in some legal trouble if I were to follow this course of action?"

Flights,"FYI - Not paying/allowed a carry on doesn’t mean you can’t use overhead bins… Flew United cross country after the holidays and all I had was a checked bag and my backpack. The ticket charged for checked and carry on but I only purchased the checked. My back pack is a roll too that was pretty stuffed and weighed 25lbs. I had an economy plus seat with extra space but still didn’t want it under the seat in front of me so just put it above me. Don’t know if it’s common knowledge at this point but nobody is stopping you from utilizing the bin above, just on the functional size of your unofficial carryon. I can get more in my bag and would probably get it by as a personal, the one thing that sells it is that it’s on my back. 

Of course the budget airlines nickel and dime you and stand at the gate grilling everything coming through but on majors it’s usually fine. Get yourselves bigger backpacks than the traditional Jansport/Eastpak and game the system. I’m not talking something you can traverse Everest with but there’s some leeway there if you’re slick about it. Patagonia has a duffle that doubles as a backpack that is exactly perfect for this.

But my wife would have her and the 3 kids (6 6, and 4). I haven’t looked at the cost to get assigned seats but even if it was a bit extra we’d be okay with that. 

On the way there I would leave early to pick them up at the airport when they arrive in Orlando. This is slightly risky because if the flight is cancelled not sure what we’d do. On the way back I’d drop them off so if the flight got cancelled I’d turn around to get them and drive back.

Flights,"Got denied check-in at airport unexpectedly Hi.

My friend was traveling from Helsinki to Ho Chi Minh city on Turkish airlines. However, something unexpected happened while she was trying to check in at the check-in desk at Helsinki airport. The airline/airport staff demanded that she had to present her bank card that had paid for her flight transaction. Unfortunately, she left her bank card at home as she thought that she wouldn't need it in Vietnam, and none of us had ever heard about showing a bank card to get checked in. After explaining the situation, the staff told her to contact directly Turkish airlines. Other than that, they refused to offer any bits of help, instructions, or alternative solutions and ignored her completely. My friend tried to call Turkish airlines but the calling queue was crazy long. While waiting for their answers, she managed to have a picture of her bank card (with help from another friend of hers). The staff still rejected the attempt. We went through her flight information in her email and nowhere in the rules asked to bring a bank card in advance.

Finally, we found on Turkish airlines' official website, states that ""If you do not approve the said notification, your transaction will not be completed and you will be required to enter another credit card."" ([https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/any-questions/in-which-cases-the-physical-presentation-of-the-credit-card-is-requird-how-can-i-present-it/](https://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/any-questions/in-which-cases-the-physical-presentation-of-the-credit-card-is-requird-how-can-i-present-it/)). My friend suggested buying again the same flight or changing payment method to ""Debit"". None of the staff gave a shit. ""We can't do anything"" was their motto.

We are extremely disappointed with the airline service. To put it bluntly, anyone could do a better job than these airline staff because they were not willing to help their passengers who were in trouble. Their manners were unprofessional and disrespectful by ignoring, and refusing to communicate. We filed a complaint email and got apologized by the airline with a full refund. My friend bought a new ticket which was much more expensive and the full refund amount is almost a joke. The situation also wasted many people's time and nerves due to the lack of collaboration from the airline/airport staff.

So I have questions:

\- If a physical bank card is required during the check-in, what would happen if your flight is bought by your loved ones (e.g. friends, families, spouses) who are living in different cities or countries? That makes me worried af cuz I sometimes buy flight tickets for my boyfriend and vice versa.

I was on a flight this morning with my wife and two year old son. 25 minutes from our destination the engine exploded/caught fire. The cabin filled with smoke… and the flight attendants started creating panic. Yelling “Oh my god! The engine is on fire! The smoke! Oh my god! Oh my god!” You get the idea. I was certain we were going to meet our doom and we had to put on a brave face for our baby. I’m already terrified of flying and this has rattled me to my core. The pilots didn’t address it. The flight attendants kept creating panic in the back and were completely unprofessional about it. 

I noticed we came down very close to the water for the remainder of the flight, and the sounds from the engine that blew out were scary (rattling and like a car turning over). 

We were met on the tarmac by two fire engines and took a bus back to the terminal. 

This was on a flight from the states to a vacation city in Mexico. I’m still nauseous and all I can think about is our flight home Friday or how to get out of this situation. 

Any thoughts, advice, or guidance? I doubt I can relax over the next few days until I can somehow figure out to switch airlines or get out of this flight home with Spirit without being penalized. I feel the lack of professionalism made the situation SO much worse. They created more panic than there already was.

Flights,"Booked international-to-domestic transfer with the same airline on the same ticket, but is the layover long enough? Hi - I'm flying from NYC to Osaka by way of Tokyo (HAN) on Japan Airlines. 

My flight gets into Haneda at 4:45AM in Terminal 3, and my flight to Osaka leaves at 6:30AM from Terminal 1. 

On the Japan Airlines website, it's saying you need to go through immigration when you land, which will take 70 minutes, then take a shuttle to Terminal 1 which looks like it comes every 15-20 minutes, then go through domestic security which you need to clear at least 20 minutes before departure. 

This seems like 105 minutes is cutting it awfully close, but I booked this trip on one ticket directly through Japan Airlines so I have to think the system wouldn't have done that if it isn't doable? (Does that 70 minutes for clearing immigration include transit time?)

Also, there seem to be some confusing discrepancies about whether I'll need to pick up my checked bag in between and re-check it, or if I can check it all the way through to Osaka when I leave NYC. (I think it's the latter? Hopefully?)

Finally, I'm a little confused that on the JAL website it's saying that after clearing immigration at Haneda you need to go to a Domestic Transfers counter in Terminal 3, but the hours of that counter open at 6:30 AM which is too late for my flight. 

I've never done a connection that's this tight before (last international layover was 8 hours haha), so would love any advice/wisdom here. Thank you!!"

Long story short. I was boarding on my flight to Sofia and was at the gate scanning my boarding pass. Suddenly, the machine gives out an error and prints out a small paper saying - ""New Seat//Neuer Sitzplatz"" and the ticket had moved me to Business class seat. I personally do not know the reason as to why would I get moved, because I didn't pay anything extra or ask any agent to do that for me, other  than check in early on-line.   


Another note - The flight was full, I think. I recall the gate agents making announcements asking for volunteers if they would like to take a later flight and even offered them 250EUR as a bonus, but I am not sure that would be the reason they would upgrade me.   


Thus, I'm curious, if anybody knows what had happened, or if anybody has experienced something similar before.

2. Given that I don't travel that much, I thought about just applying for a TSA Precheck renewal, but their website doesn't acknowledge my KTN.  The error is: ""KTN is invalid. Please try entering it again.""  I double checked that the website says to use my PASSID from GE, which is what I'm using.  Has anyone had this problem before?

So I’m flying tomorrow with Turkish Airlines to Zagreb with a layover at IST. I’ve upgraded my first leg into business using miles.
According to the TA app, I have one piece of carry-on however original Business bookings get 2.

I was wondering whether if they will double check my carry on allowance at the gate when boarding if I try to take an extra piece with me. Will they find out? And if they spot me, will I have to gate check it? If so would it cost me money? I have 2 pieces of check baggage allowance and I’m going to use one. So I wouldn’t go over allowance.

Besides that, for my second leg, would it work if I make an excuse based on my first leg being business and being allowed to take two carry-ons?

P.S.
I understand that this may not be an ethical practice. But I have plenty of stuff that can send to checked baggage and besides that, business class cabin is designed for 2 carry-ons per customer so I wouldn’t give a hard time to other fellow passengers anyway.

Had a flight to Hong Kong with malaysia airlines and 3 bags totalling 70 kg did not make it with us to Hong Kong. We had a connecting flight in Malaysia KUL. All checked luggage of passengers who flew in the same route as us did not make it to HKG. basically, the first flight was delayed and the transit time was around 30mins for the flight from KUL&gt;HKG. we had to run to reach the flight as well.

so we filed a report at the baggage desk for malaysia airlines. they had no idea where the bags were, and they told us we could reimburse expenses until our bags were located and sent to us. even though we reside in hong kong, we are not permanent residents. we are citizens of a different country. we came back to HK after a 1.5month stay in another country, so basically almost all our clothes were in it, along with a bunch of RAT kits we needed in order to test ourselves in the next few days. So we get some clothes, toiletries and RAT kits for the next two days. They ultimately found the bags and returned them to us the next day (&gt;24h delay)

and 15 days later malaysia airlines tells us they will not reimburse us because we hold a permanent address in hong kong, and according to their policy:

&gt;A one-off payment is only offered to passengers who are non-resident at the arriving station and also in the event that the baggage is not restored to passengers, allow us to clarify that upon checking on the PIR report, we noticed that your permanent address is in Hong Kong (XXXX) additionally a travelling passenger will have a booking back to residential country while in this case the last location is Hong Kong hence we are not able to accede for compensation for the delay.

Not only is this policy not mentioned anywhere in their website, but the guy at the baggage desk didnt even mention this to us (not that it would have made a difference, we still needed clothes to wear and RAT kits). understandably, we have a permanent address in HK but that does not mean they get to wash their hands off just that easy, the responsibility for fair compensation still falls on them.

what is the best course of action in this case? advice appreciated. TIA"

I (19) had to go with my little sister (5), only the two of us. Went to book my seats, but I wasn’t surprised no seats were available for choosing, except two next to each other, for almost a thousand dollars because they were premium, and I don’t have that kind of money to spend on a 5 hour trip. So I called the airlines, and they said that their policy is that they place any child or person under 16 with an adult, and they told me not to choose my seats until then.

Went to the airport, and found out we were given two seats with a person in between. I asked the gate agent if we could switch, she started yelling at me how I should’ve chosen my seat and that it’s not her problem, then went on the speaker to say that no one should ask her to be switched, which confused me since it wasn’t a full flight, there must’ve been some place, and she could’ve been calmer, but whatever I guess.

Got on the plane, my sister was given a window seat, and I, an aisle seat. There was a man in the middle, so I asked him if he would be able to switch with me or her (either window or aisle, his choice) so I can sit next to her since she’s only five, he said: “Miss, don’t worry, I’ll just stay in the middle.” I asked him and assured him it’s going to be better for all of us, but he said the same thing, so I was like alright I won’t be annoying. 

It was so awkward, he kept looking at both of us weird and I felt uncomfortable. I made her sit in the aisle because he refused to get up when she wanted the bathroom, he wanted her to go over him and said he didn’t mind if she was in contact with him while sleeping, which I thought was creepy. I know I’m stretching it but it doesn’t sit right with me, so the aisle was better since he would have to get up for me.

Of course there are much more reasonable fares at less desirable times such as departing at 7:00 AM and 5:00 PM, with change fees of $80 or one-ways for about $300. I never knew that the noon flight from Tampa to Mexico City was in such high demand, lol!"
Flights,"Does the 24 hour refund rule apply only for the ticket cost or also for payments made for additional amenities?  

Found this sub after posting this already to r/travel. But felt this sub is better for this question. I recently booked a flight on Emirates from JFK to Dubai. Along with the flight, I also purchased seats with more leg room for additional $400. However, I cancelled the ticket within 24 hours of purchase. Emirates has refunded me only the ticket cost and has not refunded me the additional payment I made for the special seats. Does the DoT's 24-hour cancellation rule cover additional amenities purchased or only the flight ticket cost? I could not find any information on the DoT website and any inputs here would be helpful. Thank you."

When the ground crew did collect us they sent word ahead and said they would hold the aircraft but upon getting to gate C14 we were abruptly told no go to customer service.

We did this and were told they were holding the plane and it was our fault for not getting there sooner! Nor was there going to be any offer of hotel or food vouchers the ground crew is not United's responsibility.

*""CDC will require a negative COVID-19 test result...for all travelers aged two years and older to the United States on flights originating from the People’s Republic of China (PRC), including the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau.""* 

However, this is the part that's confusing to me:

*""This will also apply to persons traveling from the PRC via* ***third country transit****""*

\[[Source](https://hk.usconsulate.gov/health-alert-2022122901/)\]

The CDC's statements reads the following: 

*""The requirement* ***does not apply*** *if you transited through an airport in China, Hong Kong, or Macau en route to the United States from another country, or if you spent less than 24 hours in China, Hong Kong, or Macau.""*

\[[Source](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/testing-international-air-travelers.html), which is included in the US Consulate site\]

Flights,"Flight delay advice! NRT-IST-SZG Hello!

My wife and I are traveling from NRT to SZG via IST with Turkish Airlines in Economy class. This is the return of our trip to Japan.

The flight time of the first leg has been extended (but departure time stays the same) meaning that we now miss the connection to Salzburg. They’ve booked us on to the next flight to SZG that leaves the following morning.

Can you advise what I’m entitled to in terms of accommodation and compensation? Any watch outs and recommendations on what to do when I land in IST to expedite the situation?


Original flight:

NRT &gt; IST tk0051 09:45 - 17:20

IST &gt; SZG tk 1383 18:20 - 18:55



New flight time and route:

NRT &gt; IST tk0051 09:45 - “after 18:00” according to desk staff (though the flight number is still showing the original schedule on Google) 

NIST &gt; SZG tk 1381 07:50 - 08:25


Other info:

- I’m a gold star alliance member (senator with Lufthansa)

- this is the 3rd flight change/issue from TK. Two changes to original booking were made by airline before the trip; one meaning we had to change departure airport from SZG to VIE due to flight cancellation (we paid train costs ourselves) and one pushing our NRT departure time from 09:20 to 09:45.

Flights,"Lufthansa refuses to give carrier statement (confirmation of cancelation + reason) for credit card claim My partner and I flew via Lufthansa from Charlotte, NC, to Lisbon, PT, back in November and were around 30 hours late getting to our destination. For the first leg, we were originally booked on flight LH429 (CLT to MUC), departing November 9, but once on board, the captain said that there was a mechanical issue with the plane and that the flight was canceled. After getting off the plane, we managed to rebook the same flight for the next day, November 10, and went home (we live near the airport). The next day, after yet another \~2 hour delay and a resultant missed connection in MUC, we finally arrived in Lisbon about 30 hours after our original arrival time.

I am trying to file a claim with my Chase credit card to recoup the missed night in the hotel at our destination, and also a food and wine tour that we missed out on due to the late arrival. Chase wants a statement from the carrier stating that the flight was canceled and the reason, but the Lufthansa agent I've been emailing states that the November 9 flight was “delayed to actual arrival time"" and also says that Lufthansa does not give a reason for cancelation as a company policy. I keep asking what ""delayed to actual arrival time"" means (because the plane never left the ground), but the agent will not clarify. I've asked to escalate to another agent and threatened to contact the US DOT, but the agent just responds that their ""response remains the same.""

Lufthansa has already given us 1200 *€* for the extended delay, so at this point, all I want from them is a statement so I can recoup the remaining expenses. Besides following through with the threat to contact the DOT, is there anything else I should try, or will Lufthansa never confirm the cancelation and give a reason?"

When I inquired about when my flight would be refunded (its been 11 days, DOT says 7), the rep handling my case sent me this breakdown that deducted the cost of the first leg of the flight where Southwest left me stranded in Texas, no where near my destination OR my home, lost my bags, and told me I was on my own to figure it out from there... On Christmas, no less. 

I wasn't even supposed to get off the plane when we landed in Austin. It was just a connection, no layover. They unloaded us, promising us that a flight crew was on the way... They announced every step of communication with the flight crew that was coming for us (made contact, they're descending, they landed... the whole gate even stood up and applauded when they landed. The next announcement was that our flight was canceled). I've never been to Austin in my life. I was traveling alone. My final destination was New Orleans... 

I'm belly laughing at this point at the audacity of this company. They are really going to try to deduct money from my refund for the flight that got me in this mess in the first place? They never took me to New Orleans. Southwest left me stranded in a place I had no intention of going, lost my bags, threw me into a panic trying to figure out how to get out of there... and then has the guts to shamelessly try to deduct that leg of the trip from the refund I asked for....

Oh, and they deducted the cost of the flight to get me back to my home city. After the runaround Southwest had just put me through,  the least they could do is get me back home, right? Or nah? Not exactly what I would call ""going above and beyond""...

However, I’ve never completed a transaction through virgin airlines so I can’t actually buy points to take advantage of this. Booking a normal economy flight through AA is also about $2100, which compared to the former seems like a complete ripoff. I’ve currently booked that flight just to be safe because I can’t find anything else. I have free cancellations on that flight so if i find something better I can always cancel the AA flight. I’m looking for good deals on business class or first class because it is such a long flight. If anyone has tips or could help me I would greatly appreciate it."

Flights,"Turkish Airlines bad experience Hey guys, yesterday I had the crappiest experience flying from Istanbul to Hamburg with Turkish Airlines and I just wanted to share it: So I had booked this roundtrip flight from Hamburg to Istanbul and back and it was all okay on the outgoing flight minus the slow, inefficient flight attendants, but when I was coming back to Hamburg I noticed that there was SYB written on my boarding pass instead of my seat number despite me completing the online check in before my flight. I thought nothing of it and assumed that I would be assigned a seat later but the pass gave me an error when I was trying to scan it at the gate. I took the pass to the supervisor and they said it was okay, so the gate controller rescanned it and I passed through somehow. However, when I was going through the final check before boarding the plane, the officer told me that I could not board because I had no seat assigned to me and that I had to wait until everyone else had boarded. And then when everyone else was boarded, he told me that I had to board a flight that was coming tomorrow night! Thats where I argued with him that I had paid for my ticket and their system problem is not my fault, and they finally assigned me a seat manually and I boarded the plane alongside another person with the same problem. It was a stressful situation through and through. I had flown with Turkish before a few times because of their student offer (maximum luggage weight of 40 kgs and discount) and the flight attendants' incompetency was bearable, but I think this incident is the last straw for me and I would never ever fly this airline again, the jump-scare they gave me kinda ruined the vibes of my nice holiday vacation. Not to mention that the main breakfast consisted of runny eggs and some small ham toast. (Ps: the Istanbul airport is the shittiest, most disorganized airport I have ever been to.) 

In any case, does anyone know what's the deal with the whole SYB thing? How did that even happen? Thanks in advance!"

Who would I check in with at Heathrow? From what I've found online I THINK it's BA, but it just seems wrong considering I booked with Qatar so I just want to confirm?

Whose baggage requirements do I have to adhere to? My booking confirmation says I'm allowed 25 kg checked luggage, standard for Qatar, but BA only allows 23 kg. My suitcase has too much in it volume wise, but is underweight for both at a current 20.1 kg, so I want to put the rest of what I need in a box or something and use the rest of my weight allowance for that. Qatar allows passengers to split checked weight allowance across several pieces, which would let me do this, but BA does not. Obviously I would rather go by Qatar's rules as this lets me do what I need but I'm a bit concerned that if I have to check in at a BA desk they'll make me pay extra for an extra checked bag even though it'll only be around 5 kg.

The US CDC and Australian government websites have really helpful info on their websites indicating that transit passengers are test exempt. As usual, the Canadian government website isn't anywhere nearly as helpful. 

According to the airline's website (Cathay), testing isn't required. Can anyone confirm? Info seems to be really thin on the ground here considering how much havoc this is likely to cause for thousands of passengers over the next few weeks."

Do I have any way of getting more than just half the first ticket price I paid? Long story short, I went to Ethiopia. Turkish cancelled my flight back to the USA while I was there.

Flights,"Flying one-way to MAD in Business Class Planning to relocate to Spain in the coming month. Since I'll have loads of stuff to carry, thinking of booking Business Class one-way (2 x 32kg bags). However, airlines like Saudia and Finnair are seemingly offering attractive prices for my leg of the trip, if I book a round trip. 

Can I book a business class to Madrid and an Economy flex (fully refundable) back to my home country and cancel the 2nd one without repercussions?

A rough overview of the costs:

1. One-way from Home country to MAD (Business Class): 950 USD
2. Round trip: 540 USD (Business Class) to MAD and \~425 USD (refundable economy) to home

So if I could cancel the return flight to my home country and get the refund, the business class flight becomes a pretty good deal.

While we thankfully added in a buffer day for our travel, and hear ICN is the best place to have a layover it would be nice to not have to bank on that. Flight is KE094 which is consistently 30-60 minutes early from the looks of it. From what I researched online this is still a massive gamble. But the bigger worry is whether or not our seats that were picked are retained (GF's first intl flight, and she's a nervous flyer). When I check the booking on their website I am only now allowed to see the flight schedules and new changes and a big ol' REFUND button, and cannot view seating arraignments to see if they changed also.

   * Do I need to collect my checked luggage and re-check it? IAH has this airside train to move between terminals, and my understanding is that I still need to go through immigration.

Is there any max time limit when I can check-in it?

Flights,"JFK to Haneda with 1hr40min connecting layover through Toronto Pearson vs direct flight? 
Hi everyone! My bf and I are looking to travel to Japan at the end of May for two weeks. We want to fly into and out of JFK &amp; Haneda airport. The flights we are looking at for now are direct flights (ANA), or a connecting flight through Toronto Pearson airport (Air Canada) with a layover of just 1hr40mins. 

Is that enough time to catch our connecting flight to Haneda? Do I have to go through customs again? From what I can find, all Air Canada flights are based in Terminal 1 so I shouldn’t have to switch terminals, and their website says to budget for 1hr for connection. But I’m worried that with COVID and flight delays, we won’t be able to make the connection. The direct flight is obviously safer and will save us at least a half day extra in travel/vacation time, but it is also $700 more than the layover route and we would like to save that money to spend  on the rest of the trip if we can. 

If anyone can share their past experience or give any advice that would be greatly appreciated!"

Flights,"I booked a flight on MyTrip.com .... Hi all

As the title says, I booked a flight with a third-party called mytrip.com. As you can probably tell from me saying that I booked with a third-party website, I am very inexperienced with travelling and thought it would go smooth, but alas: no.

I'm going to Europe to study, and since I'm not from the EU I needed to get a student visa from the French embassy. They delayed my visa process until the last day, and now I am 7 days away from my flight date, while the embassy has asked me to wait for at least 14 days to get my visa, meaning I need to reschedule the flight.

Reading online I've found out that mytrip.com is borderline a scam website, and there's a lot of people everywhere saying that they haven't got their refund/reschedule money back (be it on Google play reviews, Google, reddit). I'm afraid to ask for a refund or a rebooking because of this. I'm sure I won't ever see my money back if I ask for a refund.

How should I proceed?? This flight cost me a shit ton of money, and I don't want to lose it because I don't know what I'll do if it have to buy another one at full price. On the other hand, from reading reviews online I know for sure that I won't see my money back if I ask for a refund/rebook. 

It was really stupid of me to buy a ticket there without researching online. Lesson learned: always book directly with the airline.

Btw: I've called the airline and begged for them to deal with me now instead of MyTrip and issue me the refund directly, but they've said that they legally can't do this. ""If you want the refund, you unfortunately have to talk to MyTrip. There's nothing we can do"", they said."

We are planning on doing a roundtrip flight booking from Calgary to Seoul. We will stay there for 2 weeks. During this time, we will head south to Busan, take the ferry over to Japan, and work our way up to Tokyo. We will then take a separate flight from Tokyo for the purposes of getting to Seoul to make it back for our roundtrip flight back to Calgary. 

Now my concern is, if the first flight from Tokyo to Seoul is delayed or cancelled to the point where we don't make the return flight (Seoul to Calgary), do we still get compensated for the 2nd flight that's not technically associated with the first? If not, will trip cancellation insurance cover that? Or am I pretty much out of luck. I will be planning some leeway time but there's still always a chance of that happening. For ex. this year I had a flight delayed by 5 DAYS. Realistically I cannot leave that much leeway. As such, I would rather have the need-to-know about this before it happens."

Flights,"Frustrating experience with delayed baggage I recently flew from London to Auckland, having booked all my flights directly through ANA --&gt; London Heathrow to Tokyo Haneda, Tokyo Haneda to Sydney Kingsford Smith, and Sydney Kingsford Smith to Auckland International.

Unfortunately, one of my check-in bags was left behind in Haneda. As per ANA policy, upon landing in Auckland, I filed a missing baggage claim with Air New Zealand, which happened to be the operator of my last flight from Sydney to Auckland (an ANA code sharing flight),

Now, it has been more than a week since I filed the missing baggage claim, yet my bag is still sitting in Haneda unchecked. 

When I write to Air NZ, they tell me they do not have a baggage handling team based in Haneda (they only operate out of Narita in Tokyo), and that if they do somehow receive the bag either in Narita or Sydney, they will send the bag my way straight away.

When I write to ANA, they reply me with the most generic copy/paste stating their policy and asking me to write to Air NZ instead. I have also tried calling ANA Haneda's baggage handling number, but the number does not seem to work.

To me, the most frustrating part is that my bag is clearly under ANA's possession in Haneda, they are the one holding up the process, yet they refuse to do ANYTHING about it and ask me to speak to Air NZ. While Air NZ has been as helpful as they can be, they have never laid their hands on my bag, so how do I expect them to be of any use?

Flights,"[Help needed] Flight from Athens, Greece to Denpasar, Bali Looking into having our honeymoon in August to Bali but after searching a bit in Google flights &amp; Skyscanner all tickets seems so expensive.   
Right now looking into one way ticket because we are discussing staying 2 days in Singapore.  
For one way tickets Qatar is the cheapest around 650$. All others are 850+.   
When first searched there was a flight from Singapore airlines at 970$ (go and back) but they changed the price to 1700$.  


Is this because of xmas holidays? They change the prices because many people book tickets during xmas? Should i wait a few weeks for this so other airlines can match Qatar prices or is it a risky move and maybe Qatar gets even pricier?"

I'm only staying in NY for 6 days and I'm afraid they are not going to deliver my bag in that time

So my question is how good are they at finding missing bags and delivering them? What's the probability I'm going to get my clothes back while I'm in NY?
And I'm I entitled to any compensation?"

Flights,"Could airport have taken stuff without my knowledge? I was departing from LAX to Heathrow (not my final destination), a few days back. I had a small carry on bag which I put jewelry in (nothing expensive). They were a few rings, some bracelets, and a necklace (they’re valuable because of who got them for me).

Went through my first flight from LAX with no problem, checked my bag, all is good. I went through Heathrow’s security, and then to my final destination (country where they didn’t check my bag at all so I know nothing happened). 

No one was sitting near me, and my bag was besides me so I’m sure it isn’t stealing from another passenger.

I came home to realize ALL my jewelry is gone, and I realized Heathrow is sometimes strict with security, but there’s no way they would’ve taken my stuff like that, yeah?

They’re really sentimental to me, so it really upset me to lose them. What could’ve happened? I know FOR SURE I didn’t take them out myself."

Once in London, the goal is to catch a flight to Marrakesh, Morocco the same day (the 7th).

Option 1 -- Book British Airways flight to Marrakesh leaving Heathrow at 12:20pm, giving us a total of 2 hours 40 minutes between gate arrival to departing. I am really worried we will not make this.

Option 2 -- Book either British Airways or Easy Jet flight from Gatwick Airport to Marrakesh leaving around 5:00pm. This would give us around 7 hours, but would require and airport transfer. This also doesn't put us in Marrakesh until around 9pm.

Sharing this story in hopes that others can benefit from it. Yesterday, my husband and I were flying to Florida on Frontier Airlines. We hadn't booked seats because this flight was replacing a cancelled Southwest flight (another long story), and we were just happy to have a spot on the plane/didn't want to pay extra. We checked in, went through security and made it to our gate with plenty of time to spare, only to hear a boarding announcement that the wrong plane was sent (?) and they now had 45 less seats. They announced Frontier policy is to give preference to those who booked seats, so everyone without seats started scrambling to figure out if we'd get on, while people with seats stood by pretty carefree. It was honestly one of the worst feelings in the world, and led to such regret over not spending the extra ~$30 to book a seat. There were four seats remaining for us that did not book seats. My husband got one of them, which is great because his family was already in Florida and if one of us was able to go, that's better than nothing. However, I didn't get on and therefore am missing the entire vacation because Frontier didn't have any flights (out of my local airport or any airport with 300 miles) for the next 5 days, which is just a sad feeling. So bummed and begging you all to PLEASE LEARN FROM US AND BOOK SEATS ON FRONTIER!"

I  am scheduled to Travel from Klagenfurt, Austria, to Brussels Charleroi, Belgium, (Flight number: FR4961) on Dec 31 and was informed a few hours ago by email that the flight was cancelled. This is due to strikes, but from Ryanair baggage employees:

[https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1714479/ryanair-strike-new-year-cabin-crew-pilots-flights-belgium-travel-chaos](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1714479/ryanair-strike-new-year-cabin-crew-pilots-flights-belgium-travel-chaos)

From what I gather, I might be entitled to 250 euros based on EU261 because it is a flight under 1500km and I was given less than 14 days notice: [https://www.flightright.com/your-rights/eu-regulation](https://www.flightright.com/your-rights/eu-regulation). Cancellations caused by strikes are one of the exceptions to this, but from what I've read it seems ambiguous whether strikes by employees of the airline itself are included in this. 

To add to this, the email informing me of the cancellation 3 days from now has this legal disclaimer, claiming that I am not entitled to the compensation under EU261, but because they have given more than 14 days notice (which they clearly have not).

I should be able to get up to $250 refunded from my job, but definitely don't see anything around there, unless I'll be in an airport all day, in which case I may spend the difference at the bar.

Part of me thinks the airlines may reduce some prices soon to entice customers who have had bad experiences or heard about bad experiences recently to come back. Part of me thinks they won't care about this, and attempt to recoup some of their losses. Especially since it seems to be across the board.  Of course Southwest does seem to be the most effected, but they don't fly to MOB, so specifically they won't be effecting my choice."

Flights,"Turkish Airways lost our baggage thanks to a delay by another airline on the same ticket—solutions? I’ll try to be as concise as possible, but I may be a bit rambly, so apologies in advance.

My family and I were traveling from SFO to Istanbul on the 26th. Our original plan was to go through British Airways the entire way—it was all booked on the same ticket. We would go SFO → LHR, have a 3 hour layover, and then fly LHR → Istanbul. 

Right away, BA altered our flight times so our layover was shortened to an hour and fifteen minutes, and refused to let us change our flights to extend the layover, since this was a tight squeeze. Not many options there, but if we rushed, it was still possible to make it. 

We checked in 2 bags, both of which had AirTags for tracking purposes. 

The day of the flight (the 26th of Dec), our flight’s takeoff from SFO was delayed by ~2.5 hours. We ended up landing at LHR about 30 minutes after our flight to Istanbul took off. BA, to their credit, was waiting right outside our flight’s arrival gate with replacement tickets for everyone who missed their flight as a result of the delay.

BA provided my family with tickets through Turkish Airlines flying to Istanbul. When we asked about our bags, they assured us that they would be loaded on the Turkish Airlines flight.

We land in Istanbul early morning of the 28th (today). Our bags are (surprise) not there. The AirTags show that they’re still at Heathrow. We talk to Turkish Airlines Lost &amp; Found, and they tell us that they’ll get those bags on the next flight from LHR to Istanbul, and they should be landing in Istanbul around 6:15pm, after which, they’ll deliver them to our hotel. 

Well, we just checked the AirTags at 6:15, and the bags very clearly did not make it on this flight to Istanbul either, as they’re sat in the same place in Heathrow. We were given a Whatsapp number to contact, which we have, and the responses have been unhelpful to say the least.

(i.e. my family: “Our bags have been left at Heathrow, and we were hoping we could get a status update”

The representative: “subscribe”)

It’s likely a language barrier, so I also called the Turkish USA number, and they told me their “operational systems are down” and therefore they cannot send a message to their LHR team. 

Now, we’re a bit stuck. How likely is it that we’ll actually get our bags back? Is there anything we can do to help with the process? We just feel a bit helpless given that all we can tangibly do is stare at the location of the AirTags.

Thanks in advance for your help."

Now VA has cancelled the outbound flight and rerouted with a connection in the opposite direction, with four hours between my flight with the first airline and onwards flight with VA.

I haven't accepted the change yet; options are:

- Having a 30 hour layover and changing to a direct flight the next day. If VA allows it could change the return flight to a day later, but that would leave only a 2 hour connection time.
- Flying from city 1.5 hours away and 3 hour layover (risky and adds cost for travel)
- Accepting the change, however a 4 hour connection time is more risky in case of delays &amp; if I accept it may be deemed ""at my own risk"". Also not keen on flying backwards.

I want to book flights from the UK to Taipei with a stop over in HK, and I want to do this using my Asia mile points. However I wondered what would happen if after booking the tickets I decided not to go on to Taipei and just get the flight to HK? Obviously I would let the airline know in advance. Would I loose the whole ticket or pay a penalty? 

I really want to go to Taiwan however the politics are very up in the air atm so just trying to understand my options.

Flights,"Is there any way to reduce chance of checked luggage being stolen? I've been hearing a lot of stories of checked luggage being broken into by airport staff and I wanted to know if anyone has any strategies to keep their belongings from being stolen. I'm not worried about the flight going to my destination as I'm not going to be bringing anything valuable, I'm just afraid they'll steal my souvenirs coming back home. 

I understand that locks do not help because they can be simply cut, and I assume that the presence of a lock would make your luggage seem more valuable in the first place. 

What about wrapping all your belongings in plastic wrap to make it more annoying to access? Or duct taping the whole luggage case? I would love to hear everyone's ideas!"

More importantly though, for anyone with experience - when do they inform you if you won?

I talked to the helpdesk person at DCA, and they rebooked us on a flight tomorrow from Richmond, VA, which is 100 miles away and a 3 hour drive during traffic, of which we don't have transportation for. She said that JetBlue would cover the transportation cost via a lyft ride, but I would need to call the 1800jetblue support line to talk about anything related to compensation and refunds for these issues. I called the number after leaving DCA and they said the Richmond flight was the best option available. They also said the exact opposite of the help desk person at DCA regarding transport--that I can only deal with covered transportation at the airport and the phone support people have no information on that. The ride will be 250$ to Richmond. Any advice/tips on how to optimize this situation? There aren't other flights to book really, except for insanely expensive random flights on Tuesday on a different airline. I don't really care about the money to get to Richmond, but that JetBlue is so unhelpful and doesn't seem to care about the massive inconvenience and clusterfuck they've caused. Thanks!"

I do eat seafood and other non-kosher things.

It seems like some of the EVA reviews I've seen have had cases where both meal options were porky (e.g. one review said the breakfast options were a cheese omelette with sausage and potatoes, or pork congee).

* Moslem Meal (MOML) - should be guaranteed not-pork
* Seafood Meal (SFML)
* Vegetarian Lacto-ovo Meal (VLML）
* Vegetarian Oriental Meal (VOML)

Any thoughts (or experiences!) on which of the above might give the most appetizing results? :) I am thinking maybe the seafood."

Flights,"Could I claim refund for ruined itinerary due to luggage loss/delay alongside value of luggage? I flew from Montreal (YUL) to Havana (HAV) on the 19th December and when I arrived, the luggage was nowhere to be found. I immediately filed a Property irregularity report (PIR) at the terminal. Due to the economic situation in Cuba, I was completely unable to find replacements for my clothes, underwear, shoes, etc. as most of the stores on google maps that I searched for were not actually there anymore, closed permanently, etc.

This has basically meant I’m stuck with one pair of socks, underwear, and only one outfit that I had to wear this entire week until i leave on the 26th of December in this tropical country. This basically stopped me from doing most of the activities I had planned as walking in sweatpants in the heat (or going swimming at the beach) is insane.

I read thoroughly the Montreal Convention and I’m wondering about Article 19 which states “The carrier is liable for damage occasioned by delay in the carriage by air of passengers, baggage or cargo. Nevertheless, the carrier shall not be liable for damage occasioned by delay if it proves that it and its servants and agents took all measures that could reasonably be required to avoid the damage or that it was impossible for it or them to take such measures.” and Article 22.1 “In the case of damage caused by delay as specified in Article 19 in the carriage of persons, the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to 4 150 Special Drawing Rights.”

So my question is, could “damage caused by delay as specified in article 19” include loss of value of the itinerary as I was hindered from reasonably doing most of my activities due to the loss/delay of my luggage? OR would I only be able to claim the max of SDR 1288 on the lost luggage?

Flights,"Why do some flights get canceled but not others? The question is less dumb than it sounds: I generally know flights get canceled for weather, ticketing, or staffing problems. 

But, I had a crazy flight home for Christmas, so I had been watching flights the last few days, and I can't quite make sense of some of the patterns I saw. I am hoping someone in the industry can explain what's going on. 

Specifically, I am confused about why some flights in and out of the same airports are getting canceled right now, but others are not. Consider Midway in Chicago. 

Tonight, there are the following arrivals all from Southwest:

**Florida:** 

* Fort Myers, FL Cancelled 9:05 PM
* Orlando, FL, In Air, 9:35 PM
* Miami, FL, Cancelled, 11:00 PM

**Ohio:**

* Cincinnati, OH, Cancelled, 9:10 PM  
* Columbus, OH, On Schedule, 9:41 PM

**Texas:**

* Houston, TX, In Air, 9:15 PM
* Houston, TX, Cancelled, 11:35 PM

Why are some of these flights canceled but not others? 

Clearly, the weather in Chicago is the same at 9:10 or 9:41, and the weather is actually worse in Columbus right now than in Cincinnati. Cincinnati is also a much bigger airport, and presumably has better de-frosting equipment, etc. 

I think the same point could be made about the Florida flights. Obviously, Fort Myers could be more hung up by cold, but what changed between Orlando and Miami in an hour and a half? If MDW could handle the Orlando arrival at 9:35, why couldn't do the 9:10 flight?

Flights,"Double Booked flights same day because priceline's website malfunctioned, denied refund from Priceline &amp; Spirit, filed dispute, lost dispute, found out my reservation was cancelled &amp; now put on hold until the phone hangs up. Sorry for the long title. I purchased a flight off Priceline on Nov. 4 for a Delta flight on Dec 24 to Jan 2 but the website said the seats were already sold. I tried two more times with different dates/times/airlines and then finally on the 4th attempt I booked a flight with Spirit Airlines.  


I got around to checking my email after working 3 consecutive shifts to find out I have 2 flights on the same dates now. 1 with Delta and 1 with Spirit. Both BNA to PDX. I call priceline and they claim they can't do anything and that I should call Spirit. Spirit says the same thing and says I need to call Priceline. After 4 hours of bouncing from Priceline to Spirit I filed a charge dispute with my new Barclay's Priceline Credit Card.   


Fast forward to today and I find out that I lost my dispute. So I call Spirit to cancel my flight and receive credit/voucher instead of doing a no-show (as well as not wanting to get molested by TSA because I had 2 reservations) and find out that they have canceled it already because there was an ongoing dispute. I told them that I lost and I need to know what the process is going to be since they cancelled my flight. The customer service rep transferred me to a supervisor. on hold for 30 minutes and the system hung up on me. Now 25 minutes into my 2nd call and transfer and I don't see this going anywhere.

I am looking to purchase a one way flight from Rio de Janiero (Brazil) to Melbourne (Australia) for the date of the 23rd of February (or other surrounding days). I was looking at the prices for flights around that time and the price was 1,500AUD. However around early January, the flights reached 5000 AUD. Are the high prices in January due to the flight being soon? Or because it is peak season/ a popular flight. Ideally I would like to book my flight as late as possible, however if the price is going to balloon to that similar of the early January price, I may have to book soon. Essentially, do you guys think the price will raise in the end of February closer to the date? Or am I safe to hold off the booking. Thanks in advance.

I’ve booked a return flight from a trip to the Baltic countries with Ryanair via Kiwi.com and I’ve done all the steps necessary, but when I try to find my trip on the Ryanair app by entering the PNR and email i get a message that “I’ve provided incorrect information”. In the Kiwi app I can see the itinerary and all and when I try to do the check in and get the boarding passes from their app they show me a message of “waiting for the airline to open their online check in”.

The reason why this gets me anxious is because 1)Ryanair usually gives you the ability to check in daaaayyyyys before the flight, if not instantly after booking, and 2)on my Go flight, which I booked via Trip.com, when I entered the PNR I got from them, in the Ryanair app, I found my trip immediately and I was able to check in normally through the Ryanair app.

Does anyone have a clue of what might be happening??

I should also mention that the return flight consists of three separate flights that I have to self check in to separately and not a connected flights ticket.

Flights,"Codeshare flight policies and flight rebooking - who is responsible? Hi All,

I travelled last week from MSY to YVR. I booked my flight entirely through the AirCanada website. My trip involved a layover in DEN airport:

- MSY to DEN (codeshare between AirCanada AC5011 and United Airlines operated by United) at ~12:30-15:30
- 1 hour layover in DEN (~15:30-16:30)
- DEN to YVR (AC8713 operated by AirCanada) (~16:30-19:30)

However, at MSY, United announced there would be a delay of at least 1 hour, so I would likely miss my connecting flight. I called AirCanada to try to rebook my DEN-YVR flight (there was another flight at ~19:30-22:30), or to find an alternative route home. I was told to get to DEN and speak with an AirCanada agent upon arrival.  

At DEN, there were no AirCanada agents as I had missed my flight by 2 hours due to delays. I walked around the airport and even went to the baggage check-in to see if there were AirCanada agents but found no one. I called AirCanada again and they informed me that this is United’s problem, since they are the cause of the delay and because it is their codeshare policy. They denied any culpability and did not offer to rebook my flights, even with a fee.

I ended up buying a new AirCanada ticket ($990 CAD) to get home the next day, and stayed overnight in a hotel. 

I tried to apply for a refund through United, but was informed that because I booked through AirCanada, the refund is on their end. 

I’m in the processing of reaching out to AirCanada, as I think they should have re-booked my flight (DEN-YVR), but I’m not sure if I have any legs to stand on.

Am I eligible for a refund or for reimbursement at all? I am hesitant to book a codeshare flight again as it seems that I am being ping-pong’d between the two airlines. 

Thanks so much in advance."

Here's my story: I purchased a ticket a couple of years ago in 2019 from AA. Unfortunately, my flight to the Caribbean was canceled because of the pandemic around April 2020 (during the 1st lockdown). Then it was rescheduled and was then later canceled during the summer (no planes going to the Caribbean due to the foreign health restrictions). In fall 2022, for the third time, my flight was canceled last September 2022 (due to a hurricane in the islands), but I was already in the U.S. waiting to make the connection when it happened. Unfortunately, that day many people like me were stuck and couldn't travel, so the airline decided to rebook all passengers a week later.  


Here's my problem: With the rescheduled flight, I couldn't wait for a week in the U.S. and then travel to the Caribbean since it was my week off, and I had work commitments. Since then, I have pleaded my case many times and explained to AA Customer Relationships for a total refund as I took the flight and only reached the U.S., where the connecting flight was canceled, making my trip in vain. AA decided to refund me for less than half of the value of my original ticket.  


 I've been doing multiple back-and-forths since September and have yet to make progress. Is anyone facing or has faced similar issues who could provide some advice, please?  
Thank you!"

So I am about to do check-in for wizzair, and it tells me to get carry on it's £42.50 which is expensive for just carry on luggage. On their fees page, it says it should be between £4-35, so not sure why its £42.50 now.

Flights,"Beware of Volaris/Frontier codesharing flights I bought a ticket from Volaris with one layover back in November and it gave no indication that the first leg of the flight would be with Frontier. Since then, I have learned that 
1) I can't check in online or through an app, either with Volaris or Frontier, because each puts the onus of check-in on the other carrier

2) This means Frontier only gave me one boarding pass,  for their leg of the trip.

3) This also means I had to pay for my checked bag at the airport with Frontier, despite the Volaris webpage on Frontier codesharing stating that absolutely nothing changes with the baggage policy. It ended up being $79 because Frontier charges out the wazoo for last-minute luggage (to their credit, they're honest about that), but that's about double what I would have paid otherwise. 

3) I was also told I had to get my checked bag from the carousel myself, which turned out not to be true (but I didn't find this out until I left the gate section of the airport to go to the carousels)

4) Now, back in the ticketing area to get my second boarding pass, I find out that Volaris does not even open up a counter until 3 hours before the flight. 

In addition, I've watched or heard of other people who:
- Had to pay twice for an extra 2 checked bags because the ones they bought through Volaris were not registered with Frontier
- Were not allowed to board a Frontier flight they had paid for because they were not on the manifest. 

I understand that I purchased a discount ticket and as such will have to do some extra legwork myself. I don't have a problem with that; I'm a seasoned traveler and I'm used to it. But not being able to check in without an agent and paying double for luggage is ridiculous.

So I guess this post is to alert other travelers to be on their toes when dealing with these tickets and also just to vent, because f%^k me I'm stuck in the ticketing area for at least another hour and whatever money I saved with this ticket just got spent on luggage."

A few months back I was on a British Airways flight out of Orlando to London. About 1 hour into the flight, we were told there was a problem with the cabin pressure and that we would have to turn back around to Orlando. A couple of hours passed as the plane had to dump fuel to lighten the load, we eventually crash-landed back onto the tarmac at MCO.

&amp;#x200B;

After a couple of hours of inspections, we were told the plane wasn't able to continue the planned journey and that we had to return back to the terminal. We were later put on a flight the next day and got home almost 30 hours later than planned. 

&amp;#x200B;

Both the airline and our travel insurance provider are adamant that we aren't entitled to a penny of compensation. Do you think this is correct? I have gone back and forth for the last two months and have hit a dead end. I'm not sure if I should keep fighting or give up? 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks in advance!"

Flights,"Is This an Acceptable Way for an Airline to Treat Me? Today (21/12/2022) I landed in Seoul from Bangkok, to find out that my connecting flight to Vancouver was cancelled. They (Korean Air) made me wait four hours, told me I can’t have my luggage back because it is “in storage”, told me they didn’t know if there would be another flight, and sent me to a hotel for the night. Should I be calling the airline and making some serious demands? Or is this run of the mill for cancellations?"

Our flight got delayed for hours, and then cancelled. They provided us with hotels and another flight the next. We still had to wait two hours in the plane, then three hours to get our suitcases and another three hours to get sorted with the hotel. In the Ryan Air's policy it says that if the flight is more than 5 hours late a refund is possible. Does this apply in this case? I tried to get a refund on the website but it says everyone boarded my flight, and the flight wasn't late or cancelled?"

Flights,"Cathay Pacific EU compensation Amsterdam &gt; HK &gt; Sydney
HK passport

On September 9 I was supposed to fly to Australia but Lufthansa cancelled my flight (still waiting for my compensation on that front…) and I was put on a flight via Cathay on Sep 12 

The flight didn’t take off for over 4 hours because there were long queues so we were told onboard we had to wait for all the passengers as there wasn’t enough staff to take off the luggage either

Because of this, we missed our connecting flight to Sydney in HK and instead it became 

Amsterdam &gt; HK &gt; Brisbane &gt; Sydney 

Our original arrival was 8pm Sydney time which instead became 9am Sydney the next day. 

Is there a way to fight against them claiming it was extraordinary circumstances? Or any advice? Should I pursue my claim through someone else or to Schipol? 

They claimed it was because of industrial action by airport security, but there is no mention of this in the news, on Schipol’s website nor of any strike notification by airport staff. The news for September 12 just state that they were understaffed in the airport. 

They also had the option to delay the Hong Kong to Sydney flight (as they told me on the plane) but they decided not to in the end. 

I am planning to email Schipol airport and ask, as they have a link for compensation towards flights that you missed due to long queues.  It states to contact airlines regarding delays/cancellations. 


Cathay owe me for another flight (the exact same route actually) owing to technical issues so I’ll have to file another claim :&lt;"

Flights,"Crazy flight experience (F28) when I was 16-17 I had my first flight alone and it was the weirdest flight of my life. It started with a 3 hour delay, that’s the calm part. We finally board and I talk to the guy next to me who is in his 20’s. This guy tell me to always use a fake name with strangers when traveling (good advice). We are waiting to take off when a few flight attendants ask a man to exit the plane (he is drunk) they found something in his luggage. His brother a few rows away from him gets up and freaks out at the flight attendants. The pilot has to help escort them off. This takes an hour or so to deal with. Well on his way back one of the guys or both idk attack the pilot that escorted them off. He was punched in the face, we were told they need to find a new pilot. It took 3 hours and we finished 2 movies and now had to watch some episodes of a show. The guy next to me gives me a shot of his alcohol he ordered. Yes it was a dumb move to accept alcohol from a stranger as a minor but I was so annoyed. We get a new pilot and then we get delayed an hour because lightning was seen to close to the airport. I don’t really remember the flight anymore because it was so calm compared to the start. We land and I’m trying to get to the arrivals area so I can go home. I see news crews and apparently we had monks on the plane and they are chanting with the incense burner. I was just so done with this fight. I had to wait till they were done to get through. Ya so that’s the worst fight experience I’ve ever had."
Flights,"Flight canceled but airline hasn’t sent me any information about rebooking or refund So today my flight from YVR - YYZ got canceled, flight number F81225.

After about 2 hours of waiting in line at the check in desk, flair told me that I have to contact support via phone to get a rebooking issued.

My question is: is there a way to ask Turkish Airlines to send his luggage directly to his next flight with Swiss without having him to pick it up first in Milan?

Booked a flight through trip.com (mistake) departing Washington DC, USA to Auckland, NZ in March. First leg was to land in LA(with Alaska Airlines) then fly Air Tahiti Nui to Auckland. 

The first flight to LA gets delayed to land at 23:00PST. The flight from LA to Auckland leaves the tarmac at 22:55PST. 

I didn’t make the delay. But the deal was already sealed. I called trip.com, got routed to Alaska, got routed to Tahiti, got routed back to trip.com. For once I bought flight protection, and I got so frustrated we ended up cancelling the whole trip with most of the refund. 

I’m just crushed because I’ve always dreamt of going to NZ (lord of the rings fan, anyone?), I couldn’t get ANY KIND OF HELP (a whole lot of sorry, we can’t do that/help you/go somewhere else), and it was supposed to be a pre-wedding honeymoon. I can’t justify the expense again.

Flights,"Ryanair non-EU boarding pass confusion I understand that many Ryanair flights require non-EU passengers to have their documents/visa checked before they are given their full boarding pass, or print out their boarding pass for it to be stamped before they can board the flight. I also understand that the Ryanair website states that only EU/EEA/UK nationals can use mobile boarding passes. 

However, my non-EU partner just checked in for a flight within the Schengen area, and her boarding pass is available within the app and does not say anything about needing a visa check. Does this mean she can use this digital version, or does the other information on the Ryanair website override this? Beneath the boarding pass download link on the website it does state that 'Boarding passes must be printed for use' - but in that case, why does the pass show up within the app? 

If anyone has had experience with this - for example being able to use the ticket in the app, but then stung with a fine for not printing the pass - then I'd be grateful for any advice! Cheers."

Flights,"TAP flight cancelled then re-booked partly with Lufthansa, then cancelled by Lufthansa and re-booked to Lufthansa only, then cancelled without email I've hit a bit of a wall with my outbound flight which was scheduled for tomorrow:

1. So I was originally supposed to leave tomorrow (Monday) for an international flight with TAP.  When I first bought the ticket, it was a 1 layover flight Europe to North America with a return, business class.
2. Then it was re-booked to a 2-layover flight: the first leg operated by Lufthansa, second and third legs operated by TAP.
3. Then Lufthansa canceled the first leg flight this past Friday, and I received emails from them with a re-booking on a flight they alone operate which was actually much better than the 2 layover flight.  TAP never emailed me here.
4. So I thought everything was fine and good.  Now when I went to check-in on Lufthansa with less than 24 hours to go, there is nothing that shows what happened in (3).  It only shows the originally re-booked flight (2) which is canceled.  When I try to check-in, it says I must contact TAP as they are the provider of the flight.

Which would be fine, but the only reason I even didn't call TAP immediately when (3) happened was that Lufthansa confirmed a re-booking to a better flight in the same class.

I called TAP and they said they have no available flights tomorrow but would be happy to re-book me (great).  Now I'm on the phone with Lufthansa to ask why my confirmation disappeared without even an email heads up?

Flights,"Help!- I have missing luggage that has to be cleared with customs, and I'm hundreds of miles from home. I flew LH402 Frankfurt to Newark yesterday. I arrived to discover my luggage wasn't here. There were a number of us in the same boat. So, we all filled out missing luggage tickets with Lufthansa. But I have several major issues:

1. I have one more flight, to Norfolk, Virginia.
2. My luggage contains items that I HAVE to clear through customs. If I don't, either I don't get the luggage, or I break the law by smuggling items. I've opted to disclose to Lufthansa this fact.
3. With two, I have to stay at the airport until my luggage arrives and personally clear it through customs. I have several agricultural products that must be inspected.

My baggage is shown to have been ""checked-in"" for the flight at Frankfurt by another airline I had used previously. It had also cleared another airport previously where Lufthansa had received them. However, there's nothing after being checked-in at Frankfurt. Following this, I'm supposed to fly to Norfolk via United Airlines.

What can I do? I want to go home. My flight is already pushed back 24hr so I can personally retrieve my luggage, and I don't have the time or money to stay in this city for days. I'm already living off meal vouchers, but my connecting flight, United Airlines, won't give me hotel tickets. I've also been awake for nearly seventy hours due to being unable to sleep on the plane or get a hotel. And I can't afford to go home, then come back when my luggage is found. I just want to get my luggage and go, but this is severely delayed. Is it possible to get around this and retrieve my luggage, legally? I refuse to abandon it.

I'm booking for trip for my friend traveling from Vancouver to Singapore in January 2023. 

The airline i'm looking at is ANA, which stops at Narita for 3.5h before landing in Singapore. He holds a Singapore passport and hasn't taken the covid-shots. From what I understand, he plans to take a ART test in order to board the plane for Singapore. Does he need to do a covid test during his layover in Narita? He's not planning to leave the Narita airport. 

Similarly, when he returns from Singapore and flys back to Vancouver using the same arrangement (SG - Narita- Vancouver), because Canada is open, I assume he doesn't need to any documentation to board the plane and was wondering if any covid test is required for his layover in Narita?

Thanks!"

How can I plan ahead? If I cancel my flights myself i will only get 15% back, but if the airline cancels then i get a full refund.

Mainly i’m wondering, when do you think they will cancel these flights? Will they wait until the day before? That’s obviously super late notice to know if i will or will not be leaving the country. 

I would hate to spend a ton of time preparing if i am just going to have to take an L and find something else to do. But i also don’t want to cancel early and lose hundreds of dollars along with the fact that i’m fairly certain the flight WILL be canceled.

Right now they are only canceled for today and tomorrow but Peru has stated a 30 day emergency. I booked through a travel agency, cheapo air.

If it’s not canceled i’m not even sure i should still go to Peru, and if things worsened while i was there i could end up having trouble getting back; though i might still go if the flights are running (we are staying with family)

It does seem like legally i should get a refund due to the state of emergency but the travel agency rep didn’t seem to care about that and said i should just wait for the flight to be canceled if i was sure it would be."

TLDR: can I get away with 1 kg over for a checked bag and almost double the weight for my carry on bag? Also, does anybody know the price for an extra checked bag at the airport?

I am going to Vietnam tomorrow and I did not realize when I booked my ticket that the baggage allowance changed due to my flight being a Code Sharing Flight. I am allowed one checked bag, one carry on, and one small personal item. The checked bag should not exceed 23kg and the carry on and personal should not exceed 7kg...

This is where I am having my dilemma. I was able to get my checked bag down to 24kg (anybody know if they will let this slide?) but my carry on bag is at 12kg and my personal item is at about 3.6kg. 

My carry on bag **without** anything inside is already 4.6kg, so I am struggling. 

Is Qatar Airlines very strict with their carry on baggage weights? This is the first airline I have flown where I am seeing people mention the weight limit being enforced. I originally wanted to just add another checked bag, but online it says it costs $250 per bag, which is definitely not worth the stuff I have in my carry on (anyone know if this is the accurate price? I tried to ask Qatar customer service and they told me I can only find out at the airport bc there is a price difference from the website). 

Any thoughts or experiences would be appreciated! I've been trying to play luggage Jenga for the past 6 hours, and just barely got my items to what they are now.

Flights,"First Ever International flight- 3 quick questions Hello! I an taking my first international trip to Tokyo in Feburary 2023. We are flying as a group of 3, all adults and all able bodied. We booked our flights as one ticket. We fly of Feb 19th from LAX at 7:15 am, land in SEA at 10:12 am. We then have a short layover of 1 hour 3 minutes. We depart from SEA to HND at 11:15 am. We will land in Haneda airport at 3 PM on Feb 20th. I have flown domestically recently but this is my first time flying internationally. I have a few questions that I wanted some advice on. 

1.  I’m worried that 1 hour and 3 minutes is cutting it very close to make it to our connecting international flight to Haneda. We booked this flight as one ticket through Delta so, in theory, it should be enough time or they wouldn’t have sold it this way. Both flights are through Delta, so should I just expect the gates to be near each other? Will I just be able to go straight to my next gate at SEA? Basically, what should I expect once we’ve landed at SEA? I don’t have my gate information yet so I understand this question might be pointless. 

2. Leading off the other question, if these flights were booked as one ticket, we shouldn’t have to collect our luggage at SEA and recheck it for HND, right? I’ve done some research on this but I’m still a bit confused because I’ve seen people say it depends on the airport and airline. I’ve also seen people say getting your luggage taken straight to your final destination could cost extra. We have two free checked bags each, so I’d like to avoid this if I have a choice. We are not changing airlines, so I don’t think we’ll have to but I wanted someone to confirm this. 

3. Should I expect another security check at SEA since we will be making a connecting international flight?"

Your claim will get processed. Eventually. To us it doesn't matter who it is by, we won't process something 2x faster because Mr. Lawyer demands payment in 14 fays.

I actually prefer lawyers however or agencies, because they're not emotional and make my job easier by providing everything I need. With customers is different, because they let their frustration speak, understandably.

But if you need to file a claim, give me your PNR, flight number, date, contact info and IBAN, receipts for expenses, and of course short description, and I'll process. I've had to chase customers hundreds of times to provide me with valid receipts or IBAN addresses, that I see it's waste of time for both of us.

Escalate to claim agency or lawyer only if you really didagree with our decision. Another tip though is that you can open a new claim or reply to the old one and ask for reinvestigation. Don't abuse this however, but generally we do see new incoming messages and duplicates of claims. I have reinvestigsted my own cases nunerous times on the requests of the passenger and I've agreed with them that indeed a compendation was due... 😀

Flights,"Will a domestic flight honor the baggage allowances of an international flight? I feel like I'm about to be royally screwed by United. I'm very much a newb to international travel so apologies in advance if I make little sense.

I booked a flight through my credit card company (BNE --&gt; LAX by Qantas; LAX --&gt; IAH by United) with 1 checked baggage (Qantas' allowance is 32kg/70lb)

After the fact, I realized I needed to get another bag. I called up Qantas, they charged me for another bag (32kg/70lb), but also said b/c of the way my CC company booked the flight, I needed to call United and purchase a 2nd bag for the LAX-IAH leg. I guess each leg was booked separately?

I tried to purchase the bag through United's app and website but it was useless. The system kept looping me around. Then I spoke w/ United rep and it was a nightmarishly confusing. Here were my main concerns:
1) I wanted to purchase a 2nd bag ($100)
2) Will the 2nd bag be limited to 50lbs. I'll be flying in from BNE with a 70lb bag; will they demand that I pay excess weight charge ($200) on the 2nd bag?
3) Will the 1st bag (prepaid when I purchased by ticket) be limited to 50lbs? If I walk in with a 70lb bag, will they try to claim that it's also over ($200)

Here's the kicker, when I tried to buy the 2nd bag ($100), they want me to buy it at the gate when I arrive at LAX... which means there will be an additional gate fee.

I'm terrified that when I walk up to the gate at LAX with my 2x70lb suitcases, those wolves are going to slap a $500+ fee for the extra+excess bags.

Should I be worried about this? I have no idea how to handle this. My CC company has been essentially useless through all of this."

Flights,"Sunwing - Toronto YYZ - Infield Terminal Flew with Sunwing Airlines from Toronto Pearson YYZ to/from a Caribbean destination recently,  in December 2022.

Have flown this route &amp; airline before the pandemic, and would like to share a major difference.  

Sunwing is now using the ""Infield Terminal"", aka ""Infield Concourse"" which is a terminal separate from Terminal 1 and Terminal 2.  I'd never heard of it before.   Apparently this is a temporary change while construction takes place in T3. More info: 
 https://news.paxeditions.com/news/airline/sunwing-flight-operations-toronto-pearson-temporarily-moving-infield-concourse-terminal-3

The impact to travelers is that when you arrive at what you think is the gate for your flight,  Gate 26, you go down an escalator to be loaded onto a crowded shuttle bus and driven to the Infield Terminal where you find your real gate.

There are some services such as washrooms and coffee,  but much more limited than at T3.

This shuttling added about 15 to 20 minutes to our predeparture time. Combined with a huge queue at checkin, and the usual queues for security,  we were over 90 minutes, maybe closer to 2 hours, from arriving at the airport to actually getting to our gate.

Oue return flight also brought us to the Infield Terminal where we had to deplane, get jammed onto the shuttle bus and then a long walk to Customs.   

Baggage was delayed substantially,  about 65 minutes from landing to first bags appearing.  Announcements identified the delay as being the need to transfer all the luggage from the Infield Terminal. 

TL;DR - 
Sunwing flights from Toronto Pearson YYZ now require extra time before your flight.   Don't be late! You really do need to arrive 3 hours before your scheduled departure time.

And be prepared for extra delays when landing, especially for checked baggage."
Flights,"Why can't I skip the first part of my travel-route? I'm a bit frustrated at the moment, and i am guessing this is a quite normal thing, but i just want an explanation and if there is something that can be done. I have a travel next week where i go from A-B-C with a 2 hour wait at airport B, all in one day. However, something has come up so that i wanted to travel from A to B sooner. I wanted to buy a new ticket to get to B a few days earlier than expected and stay there for a few days. I assumed that it would be possible for me to just go to airport B and ""continue"" my travel to C on my original date, seeing as i have paid for that distance. I called the airline to inquire about this. They asked me what day i wanted to travel from A-B instead and i told them. After a bit of waiting, i was then told that my request was ""not possible"". I mean, i will literally pay them more money since i will buy a new ticket to get to A-B, but for some reason they won't allow me to just get on the plane from B-C on my existing reservation? Why is this so difficult? I asked support why this wasn't possible and she just said ""i don't know"".

The only thing i can do now i i want to do my new plan is to buy a complete new route that will cost me a LOT of money because B-C route is very expensive. I guess this is what the airline wants me to do, but i don't NEED to travel earlier, but i would prefer to.

Is this standard practice for most airlines? My airline is Norwegian. I feel like this shouldn't be such a big deal? Why can't i just go to airport B, check in and go through security and board the plane that i have already paid for?"
Flights,"Changing seats to an empty row last minute. What's your experience? Hi! I'm beyond impressed with this subs knowledge of the intricacies of flying so I'm hoping for some input. 

I checked the seat map for my flight (Lufthansa) leaving in 2 days. I reserved the seat when booking months ago, and my row is full. However, there are a handful of empty rows, and the Lufthansa website is showing me that I can edit my seat reservations free of charge. 

Can I seriously just change my seat to the empty row free of charge? Is there any hidden fees in doing so? I've seen some of you comment that you've done this, but I can't find any comprehensive discussion on the topic. If it really works like that, can I change my seats an unlimited amount of times until they cut off access to seat changes? Are there any risks in switching to an empty row? 

I've already had a horrible experience with LH customer service getting my booking fixed, so if there's a potential for trouble in that regard, I'll probably just avoid changing seats altogether. 

I have like 30 hours worth of flights/layovers ahead of me to having a flight with a row to myself would be a godsend."

On reaching Vancouver, we realised that none of our check-in bags (a total of 4) had come to Vancouver. On checking with the airline staff at the Airport, she confirmed that the luggage was still in Paris and will be delivered by Dec 10. Today, when I followed up on the same, the airline mentioned that the bags could now come by Dec 12 and will be delivered by Dec 13, and the dates could change again basis the amount of extra luggage the flight can carry.

This is becoming a real problem for us as we have just moved to Canada on this flight and we have all our stuff in the check-in bags. We have 2 pairs of clothes and some other basic items in our cabin bags that we are managing with, but can't do another 3 days as our winter shoes, thermal wear, and jackets are in the check-in bags.

Today when I spoke to the Air France rep on the phone, she said that I can claim the compensation subject to their agent being able to determine whether the items should be compensated for basis the requirements for them and whether or not they are essential.

Looking for some help on how to go about this and if someone has any experiences that can help, please do share as there is too much subjectivity involved in what an airline agent may deem essential.

I am mainly looking to buy some clothes and shoes to deal with the winter in Canada until our bags come.

I've been using Google Flights, Alternative Airlines, and recently Sky Scanner to check prices.

I notice on Google Flights some prices are double when you try and book.  It's very misleading.  

Alternative Airlines is trying to get me to buy ticket protection through their site which adds another $200 + USD or so.  Is Ticket Protection even necessary?

Is it best just to buy through the airline if possible?  My flight is kind of complicated because I will most likely go from whatever airline takes me back to the USA to Hawaiian Airlines.  It's provided to be a pain to book on the Asiana website because they do not have my home airport (ITO) in their database.

Philippine Airlines is charging the cheapest to go home at $500 USD.  However, their reviews make me really not want to take them.  I am going to take my electric guitar in a soft case and usually I just board a flight and the flight crew just lets me put it in a closet.  Something tells me that PAL isn't going to be that chill.  I'm afraid of having to check it in and get like $300 in hidden baggage fees for that.  Plus, if you just Google reviews of them on Trustpilot and TripAdvisor it seems like a nightmare experience to fly with them.

I was able to fly here at the end of September for just under $500 and silly me I just thought that going back home would be around that give or take a few hundred dollars.  

Am I late in booking a flight?  When I booked to Thailand I only booked a week ahead and got the $500 deal from United and ANA.

Can anyone give me some good guidance?  Doing this is a bit anxiety producing.  I suffer from General Anxiety and I'm worrying about the what ifs like 'what if I miss my flight' or 'what if I have to cancel' or 'what if they change the flight and they don't even notify me' (this last one is a huge criticism against PAL)."

Flights,"Domestic to International Transfer at SEATAC Process (Separate Bookings) Hi all! I was hoping to get some feedback on a few questions I have for a potential trip. Currently, the plan is to fly from Las Vegas to Iceland by:
A. Fly from Las Vegas to SEATAC via Southwest. 
B. There is 1H 55M until I doors close to another flight by IcelandicAir at SEATAC for a direct flight to Iceland.

Prefaces:
- I am a US Citizen with a password and TSA Precheck (but I do not have global entry). 
- The Southwest and IcelandicAir tickets are separate - aka not booked together. 
- I will only have a carry on and personal item. 
I called both Seattle Airport Customer Service and IcelandicAir and know that:
- “Icelandic Air security only takes around 35mi due to it being a small airline” but aren’t all international securities combined? I’ve only flown international once out of LAX and was not pushed for time. 
- All of SEATAC - domestic and international - is connected within all the terminals via rails. 
- IcelandicAir has online check in for boarding passes. I am able to add my Known Traveler Number to my ticket beforehand. 

Questions:
- Do I have to leave the domestic terminal and get rechecked at International security or can I just take the rail from the domestic terminal to the international terminal?
- If I have to get security checked again, is 1H 55M enough? Although IcelandicAir said only 35min for security, I thought all international flights ran the same security lines. 
- Is customs for Iceland at SEATAC or at KEF (the destination Iceland Airport)? If customs is in SEATAC, won’t this take longer to reach my terminal?

Thank you in advance and I’ll follow-up with any questions!"

Flights,"NEED HELP- Travel Issue Hi! I traveled from NYC to Cali over Thanksgiving break with American Airlines and it was a nightmare. Getting there, our connecting flight has to do an emergency landing due to a sick passenger, then we don't take off for two hours, and then we have to get off because the staff needed to sleep. We waited until 3am to get hotel accomodations and it was a very bad hotel. The next day we waited more than 5 hours to find out if we had a flight and get on it. Then, on the flight back from California to NYC, we arrive to find out that the airline accidentally shipped my baggage to Florida, and I had a trip the next day which I needed my things for. The baggage arrived 4 days later to our home, and insurance paid us $300 for the necessities. As you can tell, this has been an incredibly costly experience, and just overall terrible. After almost 5 hours of work we tried submitting a claim to American and the site wouldn't let us submit it. Since I am not home, I have not gotten my things yet and need to have them mailed to me which is expensive as well. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with the situation? Are we entitled to any legal action? Any advice would be greatly appreciated."

Flights,"Do I need a Malaysian transit visa for three different connecting flights? Hi, I am planning a round trip from Perth - Manila - Brunei. All my stopovers are based in Malaysia (KL and KK).

I hold a Philippine passport and on the internet it says that I don't need a visa but others say that I do need a transit visa if it's a different PNR altogether.

Can somebody please clarify if I need a transit visa just to layover?"
Flights,"Can you claim your luggage on the second stop of a 3-stop trip? TL;DR - 2 flights out of the 3 we’re taking to Port Elizabeth, South Africa got changed. This leaves us with a hefty layover for the third flight. We have a few options, provided we could get our luggage after the second leg.

Hello, 

We are visiting my father-in-law in Port Elizabeth, South Africa for the first time in 2 years this Christmas, which we’re very excited about!

Unfortunately, our original long-haul flights were cancelled by Qatar Airways yesterday and we were offered the following schedule instead.

Flight info: 

British citizens with UK passports. 

1. MAN to DOH QR 028 - Qatar Airways
13:40 - 23:30 (Doha time)

2. DOH to JBG QR 1363 - Qatar Airways 02:05 - 09:40 (South Africa time)

3. JBG to PLZ 4Z 795 - Airlink 
17:15 - 19:00 (South Africa time)

The domestic flight from Joburg to Port Elizabeth wasn’t factored into this change, so we will end up spending the majority of our first day in Joburg Airport, which is less than ideal as our holiday isn’t that long. It also extends our travel time from 16 hours to 27 hours, when one of the main reasons we spent a little extra originally was to minimise the overall travel time.

We initially considered changing the Qatar Airways flights to a later time that we saw on Google, but got nowhere with Qatar Airways as they said it’s up to the travel agent to make the change. Travel agent said it was up to Qatar Airways. You catch the drift. 

Then we thought about changing the domestic flight, as there are multiple earlier options for this part of the trip. 

After many frustrating calls and emails, it seems ‘nobody’ is actually able to change our booking for us in any capacity, and they can only cancel/refund the whole thing, which of course we don’t want or need.

We have officially accepted the changes, but I figure we still have a few options, some of which involve us taking the hit financially and just getting an earlier flight anyway.

1. Book one of the earlier flights soon, assume we can get our luggage at Joburg, go through security/check in etc. 

2. As above, but book one of the earlier flights when we land in Joburg. If we can’t get an earlier flight, we take our original one instead.

3. Do nothing, chill in Joburg airport all day.

Unfortunately, I can’t get a straight answer from Qatar Airways on whether we can change the final destination on our luggage tag to Joburg, as they said we’d just have to ask at check in, so I’m nervous about the first two options. For option 1, because there would be a cost outlay with no guarantee of being allowed to make the luggage change and for 2. because I don’t know if it’s even possible to check in for a flight you’ve already ‘checked in’ for at the first airport. 

My partner believes there are too many variables at play, and too great a chance of our luggage being lost the more we deviate from the original schedule. 

In your experience, what can/should we do? I’m partial to option 2, but it does mean winging it on the day. Or do we just take the hit and wait the 8 hours at Joburg for the avoidance of introducing too many risks by changing things midway through the trip? 

Help most appreciated!"

Flights,"Brussels-Amsterdam-Montreal weird deal So I was searching for flights to Montreal from the Netherlands in the 01.04-05.04 (departure) and 11.04-15.04 (arrival) range. The flights from Schiphol are around  €520-540 (either direct or with a layover). 

BUT, looking for options from Brussels, there is a KLM ticket, which includes a Thalys train from Brussles-Midi to Schiphol, and the same back, yet this costs around  €430.

Flights,"(Help) missed flight cause by airline. Hello everyone! on November 9 my son and my girlfriend and I were traveling from Seattle to Bali Indonesia. via

SQ 1286 operate by Alaska airlines SeattleSan Francisco  

SQ 033 San Francisco-Singapore 

SQ 028 Singapore-bali


All the tickets were bought through the airlines website, six months in advance, pre-planning gave us peace of mind, especially dealing with a 2 year old. 

On the day of departure we drove Seattle 3 hours earlier, we made it to the airport by noon, Our departure time was 3:15 pm within 45 minutes of arriving to the airport. We were done checking in our luggage. They were already tagged and on the belt to ground service to the aircraft!

The front desk agent was printing our tickets and he gave it to us and then she told us that the tickets where invalid/vouchers!!! 
she basically told me that the tickets haven’t been paid for by Singapore airlines and they needed to pay for them!

I contacted Singapore airlines and I explained the situation. I even gave my phone to the Alaska Airlines operator so she can explain the situation. Basically she wanted Singapore to re-link the tickets to the itinerary so we were able to board the plane! 

At that point an hour has passed by and she was dealing with the people in Singapore And the language barrier was causing problems! After standing there for an hour nothing got resolve eventually Singapore said that they didn’t know what the problem was! 
Alaska airline told us they couldn’t do anything if Singapore didn’t pay for the tickets. 

At that point I was stuck!! my kid was going off the rails, running around the airport and getting very fussy because we weren’t moving or doing anything, the pressure from my partner and the whole situation was exhausting and I felt lost! I try rebooking a flight to SFO with another airline but It was to late.

 I asked the Alaska representative to call downstairs so we can get our luggage back , I proceeded to get the information and we went down and covered the luggage. 

Singapore airlines didn’t give me no response or any plan to navigate the situation. They didn’t have a  front desk because the only flight out of Seattle leaves in the morning and after that everyone that works for SingaporeAir goes back home.

I was stuck in Seattle with a crying baby!  no airline to help us, I was on the phone with Singapore airlines and I asked them if they could provide a hotel accommodation and they said they couldn’t because there was nobody in the front desk 

 I had to get my own hotel out of my own pocket I went back to the hotel, and I basically spent the whole afternoon talking and explaining to Singapore airlines the situation in the language barrier was clearly a problem.


After talking and talking with different agents, for hours I was offer a full refund and I told them that a refund couldn’t do anything for me because I was already missing a day of my vacation and I had already paid for accommodation in Indonesia, after a couple calls, I was able to get  us rebooked on another flight, leaving straight from Seattle to Singapore the next day! 

Before accepting the rebooked for the next day, I told them that I will need an accommodation in Singapore since our original flight only had a three hour layover in Singapore and after the whole fiasco we now had a 13 hours layover operator told me that they couldn’t guaranteed it to me through the phone so I had to go to a representative in Singapore.


After 17 hours, across the Pacific we landed  in Singapore, I rush to the helpdesk, and I explain the whole situation after waiting there for about an hour of arguing with the agent, I asked for the manager and she told me that the manager was taking care of an aircraft that he will be back in an hour and a half!


I was exhausted, I wasn’t going to achieve anything at that point from their side.


Accommodation was never provided. I ended up paying almost $300 on a hotel for 11 hours of sleep, even though the whole fiasco was their bidding.

By the morning we flew into Indonesia, and we enjoy whatever we could from our vacation, we flee back to the states I was told by Singapore airlines that they were going to look into the whole fiasco. 4 weeks later, haven’t heard from the airline at all. What should I do clearly they ruin our vacation they cause a tremendous amount of stress to me and my family, they didn’t care at for our situation didn’t provide any accommodation. 

Do you help us at all? I feel like I was flying with spirit, I feel hopeless and taken advantage off.

thank you for your responses they’re all appreciate it. 

Cheers!"

I have a Priority Pass which grants me access to the lounge. It also usually lets me bring a guest.

‘am i able to bring a guest in with me?’ and the person at the desk told me ‘i cant tell you if you are able to, you just have to tell me what you want’.

This confused me so I tried to clarify, ‘im not sure if my pass allows me a guest here’ and she said ‘you just tell me’ so I told her ‘i am bringing a guest’ and she said ‘okay no problem’

I didnt understand this system and I had other friends with me so I said ‘i am bringing two guests’ but she then suddenly changed her tone ‘oh you want two guests? Are you sure?’

At this point i chickened out and said ‘never mind’

My boyfriend was booked on Saudi Airlines from CDG-JED-DEL. His flight from Paris was delayed by 2.5 hours due to some technical difficulties on the plane. 

He had a 2 hour 15 minute layover in Jeddah, and he missed that flight, as the one from Paris arrived after his original connecting flight had taken off.   
The airline booked him on the next flight to Delhi, which departed almost 9 hours after his original flight. He was supposed to land at Delhi at 8:30am on 7th Dec, instead he landed at 6:30pm. 

He had to take a domestic flight from Delhi at 2:30pm the same day, to my city which he of course missed. There were no other flights to my city later in the day, so we had to book him a hotel in Delhi for the night and a domestic flight the next day. 

He's out an additional \~200 Euros for last minute bookings, as a result of this delay. He asked officials at Jeddah airport if they would book him his next flight and a hotel for the night as he needed these because of the delay caused by Saudi Airways. They said they can't do anything, because his domestic flight within India wasn't on their airline. 

Lesson learned. We never flew on this airline before and they gave us the best deal for a late booking. I guess we know why now.  


My questions:  
1) Any experiences getting the EC21 compensation from Saudi Airways?

2) What documents would we need to file a claim? Would his tickets, boarding cards, hotel booking confirmation do?

3) Would he be entitled to reimbursement/additional compensation for the cost of his new domestic flight ticket and hotel booking?

4) Should we file directly with the airline or use airhelp or a similar service? 

Would appreciate any help. Thanks."

In July of 2022 my partner and I flew to Dublin from London with Aer Lingus. All was fine on the way there but the way back our flight was cancelled. We were sat on the plane for over an hour until we were told that they had to take us off due to their staff having worked their allocated time and no other staff was there to take over. 

So many flights were cancelled that we ended up having to wait 2 days until we could book onto another flight, for an insane price of €768 for two tickets one way. Literally over double our original return flights. 

Aer Lingus at the time, told us to book onto new flights and that they would refund our new flight along with the one that was cancelled. They said this multiple times, that they would refund our new return flight. 

They are now going back on this, we have been talking with them since July. 

Has anyone had this problem/can anyone offer me any advice on how to get them to budge? 
We missed out on two days of work, and €768 is a lot of money for us.

I’m just so angry that they’ve gone back on their word and it’s been so long but I don’t want to give up.

Flights,"Wrongfully Denied Boarding by Qatar Air Staff Hey everyone,

I was on my way back home to Australia (Permanent Resident) from the Netherlands (Citizen) via Schiphol airport. The trip was booked via it.mytrip.com. 

My flight with Qatar airways was due to take off at 3:05 PM CET to Doha, and then onwards to Tan Son Nhat International airport. The plan was to transit within terminal 2 from flight QR 970 to flight TR 307, changing carriers from Qatar Airways to Scoot for my onward flight to Singapore, then finally to Sydney.

Having checked the visa requirements, I would have been fine to transit without a visa, since I had an onward ticket to a third country (Singapore) and the flight was taking off within 24 hours.

I completed part of the check in online and received a confirmation pass, then was told to go to the check in desk in order to receive the boarding pass I needed to get on the plane. 

When I got there, I told the person at the check in desk that my final destination was Ho Chi Minh City, since that was what would've come up in their system due to the aforementioned changing of airlines. She asked for my passport and visa, to which I informed her that a visa was unnecessary. 

She quickly becomes confused and calls for a colleague, who informs me that I need to apply for and receive a visa in order to board the flight. I look up the process and realised that it would take 3 business days to receive the visa, by which my flight would've long landed in Sydney. Informing the staff member about the fact that I was actually flying to Sydney, and only transiting through Vietnam, he tells me that I need a visa anyway.

I try to reroute/book the flight for a later time or different destination, but the agent at the swissport desk rudely informs me that I need to contact the booking agent, and that it's out of his hands.

After contacting the MyTrip staff, and realising that the cost to move the flight date was more than I originally paid for the whole trip, I gave up trying to reschedule.

So now my question is: What are my options? Am I entitled to a refund from Qatar Airways or Mytrip, or am I screwed?

Flights,"Dealing with Issues on Flights to Hong Kong (I am Canadian) Hi, I have a flight from Toronto to Hong Kong for Feb. 21, 2023 with Cathay Pacific. 

It lands at 6:00am and I made a separate booking from Hong Kong to Taiwan at 8:50am. It is still with Cathay Pacific but I booked it through a portal.

Because they are separate bookings, I don't believe that I am seen as ""in transit"", and the airline has told me that I will need to leave to get my check-in bags as well as go through HK Customs. 

My questions are:

1) Will I be able to make my second flight?

2) Will I be able to pass through HK Customs assuming I don't want to quarantine and do all that stuff since technically it is a transit flight.

3) For people who have gone to HK, how long does it take to get through HK Customs then get back in?"

I'm hoping to get some help from travel experts or maybe even travel agents on this.

I worked with a travel agent to book a flight from Montreal to Casablanca with Royal Air Maroc. Unfortunately, first names and last name were inverted on the ticket. I reached out to the travel agent who, with help from RAM, put in an ""other service request"" to make the change in the PNR (that's what they told me... I'm not very familiar with this jargon).

Now, they also told me that in these circumstances there are no changes to the ticket I have but that everything will be ok at the airport since there's a note in my file.

I'm not doubting the agent's word but I'm still a bit worried since I'm traveling around Christmas and the agency will be closed then and don't want to be stuck not able to travel.

Has anyone ever experienced such a situation? Any advice from TAs? I've been trying to reach the company with no luck so far.

The flight is operated by a Star Alliance partner, so when I go to the operating airlines website and enter the 6-character confirmation number, it's not able to recognize it and does not pull up my booking .

So we booked a trip first week of october from Sydney Australia to Stockholm Arlanda via DOHA Qantas on the 7th of december.

We booked the tickets via Virgin Australia and the flight was going to be operated by Qantas. 

So last week of october we got an email from Qantas saying there had been some changes to our flight, we check the booking and the flight from DOHA to Arlanda - Sweden is missing. 

So I contact virgin Australia about the problem and they tell us to sit tight and that they are working on a solution. 

Fast forward until today and they are pretty much saying the same thing, except now they (virgin Australia) is asking us to cancel the booking for a full refund or wait until one day before departure and if they haven’t found a flight then they want us to cancel our flight.

The original flight that we had booked via virgin is still available, it’s just operated by FinnAir via Qantas now, and it would cost us around 6000 AUS instead of the 4000 we payed originally.

By the looks of it, our flight from Sydney to Doha is confirmed, but the flight from DOHA to Sweden is still unconfirmed because virgin doesn’t have any seats available.

I’ve watched a couple of YT videos but you never truly know how honest the reviews are. I know it could be compared to Spirit, but is it that bad?

I’m kind of tall (6’2”) and because of a major burn injury, I stiffen up faster than the average person. That said, l usually try to get a lie-flat seat on longer hauls (5+ hours) so I don’t drive the crew and other passengers crazy. Business class for the major carriers is a little higher than I anticipated (not so far out of reach though) for my preferred dates, but Zip has a flight cheaper than what I “budgeted” for (even after all the add-ons). I know you have to pay for *everything,* but I flew business class to France in May and slept nearly the whole way there. The only thing that mattered to me was the lie flat seat. 

So, I want to hear about your experience! Do they keep a prompt schedule or run delays? Was the flight crew rude, bathrooms dirty, or seats uncomfortable? We’re you burning up or freezing cold the entire way? I want to know!

I’m going on a week long solo trip soon. My anxiety is usually fine/controlled, but I’ve had a few panic attacks before when flying. 

Last time I had a panic attack, my friend (who I trust completely and know that It was prescribed by their doctor/not street drugs) gave me a Valium and it worked perfectly. I’ve taken one one other time before during a severe panic attack. I’m trying to get an anxiety medication prescription but I’ve been off insurance and won’t get on it again until January 1.

I plan on taking 1 Valium before I leave, which will be fine, but I’d like to take a single Valium with me for my flight back. However, again, I’m not prescribed it. My friend is willing to give me their prescription bottle with it emptied out except for the one pill, or give me a Valium and I just put it in an OTC pill bottle. Is this safe legally? Should I put it in my checked bag or carry on?

1) We can credit **21.000 Bonus Miles** to your Miles&amp;Smiles membership account.

*I'm in Canada, so not sure this will benefit me unless I'm travelling in/around Turkey. I have 0 miles with their program.*

2) We can credit **9.000 Status Miles** to your Miles&amp;Smiles membership account.

*I don't see any value with this for me.*

3) We can present you with a **one-way** flight in the **Economy Cabin** to be used in a travel you will prefer. We would like to inform you that you can use your free ticket **within one year** from the date of completion of the transaction process.

*I find this intriguing - anyone know if I can have to travel or book within a year? Considering a one-way YVR/SEA-DEL if possible summer of 2024 if travel not required within the year.  Anyone used this?*

4) With the aim of improving your flight experience, we can **upgrade** **one way** on your ticket in a travel you will prefer **to** **Business Class** (cabin upgrade) **within one year** from the date of completion of the transaction process.

*I don't see myself paying full fare on Turkish to take advantage of this.* 

5) If you prefer, we can issue a traveler’s cheque that is worth **390.00 Euros that you can use to pay for ticket purchases on Turkish Airlines and AnadoluJet** flights.

*Somewhat interesting, I don't see an expiry on it though. Probably great for Europe/Middle eat flights but not great as it locks me into a long haul w/ TK*

6) As an alternative to all these offers, we can issue a **refund cheque** that is worth **300.00 Euros** that you can get in cash. 

*Always a safe bet, but feel I'd get more ""value"" out of offer #3 above since I do intend to travel summer of 2024 if it's valid.*"
Flights,"Boston - Amsterdam options April 22nd - May 6th Hi folks, 

Looking for the best/cheapest tickets to fly from Boston to Amsterdam on April 22nd to May 6th with 2 days flexibility on either side. 
Flying with three adults and two 10 year olds. Seems like AerLingus with one stop in Ireland would be the cheapest, but wouldn’t mind paying a little extra to get a direct flight. 

I’m currently seeing $1000pp direct through Delta and $720pp with 1 stop in Ireland through AerLingus.  Does anyone know if prices will change in December, early January for these kind of flights? KLM use to have deals in those weeks, but they stopped doing those. 

I also have an Amex green card with an opportunity to upgrade to platinum with 100k points.  Not sure if that could add a good opportunity here?

Any advice would be appreciated."

Flights,"Reimbursement for re-routed flight I had a two leg flight with EasyJet in September where I was unable to make my connecting flight due to a delay on the first leg. The helpdesk at the airport was unable to give me a ticket for a new flight and told me to book it myself, and ask for reimbursement later. Since there was no other flights that day I also had to book a hotel.

EasyJet rejected my EC261 claim, which I am going to dispute, but the question I have is regarding the additional ticket I had to purchase. EasyJet agreed to refund me the cost for the hotel, but only offered to pay the difference in cost between the new flight and the additional one, which means that I would be out about 100€ due to a delay caused by them.

I am quite sure that they have to refund me the full cost of the second booking (which was also with EasyJet), but I was wondering if someone could point me to the correct statute where this is enshrined. Is it also covered by EC261?

Thank you"

Flights,"Getting Off via Shuttles Hello! I recall a few times at European airports (like CDG, Paris) or North African airports (CMN, Morocco), there would be shuttles to take us to a set of stairs (kind of like an escalator) and we could just hop on the plane. Same with hopping off sometimes. That made it better than waiting VERY long times on the taxiway/tarmac.

Here is the specific scenario I’m considering: there is *NO* weather condition, and there’s just a ground delay in place (think of JFK or EWR) because no gates are free. In those situations in the past, I recall CDG offering shuttles to the terminal directly out of the plane. (Same at Frankfurt once.)

1) Is there a reason US airports don’t do this?
2) If there is a regulation preventing this, why does exist in the first place? (Historical reasons, cultural… What gives?)"

1.

Flights,"What is the point of CLEAR? It doesn't look like it increases labor productivity to me. Airlines and airports had already created a comprehensive Priority Security product... I don't understand what the point of CLEAR is and why it is so attractive to airlines and airports that have implemented it so rapidly.

The only point seems to be giving people with CLEAR service the ability to cut to the front of the security line. Fair enough, but we already had Priority Security products with all US airlines that allow people in premium classes, with elite status, or who pay for it, to do the same thing. Cut to the front of the line.

Pointedly, GE/Precheck make sense because they allow the TSA checkpoints to do less work per passenger, so they provide an actual benefit. People with precheck allow the airport to spend less on TSA agents and scanning equipment.

In contrast, at the CLEAR checkpoints, they have a CLEAR attendant escort every single passenger into the security line. I doesn't appear to me to require any less labor than the new TSA photo ID readers that automatically look up your ticket, and then the agent waves you through to the security line. Am I wrong, is there a big reduction in labor hours required to man the checkpoint that is not intuitive to me?

As far as I can tell, the ""real"" benefits of CLEAR might be:
* Deprecate Priority Boarding products and set a new norm where customers pay separately for the good priority security benefit, whereas the norm has been for a very long time that Priority Boarding is a benefit of even the lowest elite tier.
* Replace union TSA agents that man the traditional ID verification checkpoints with non-union CLEAR escorters. Not reducing overall labor hours, just switching from better compensated job to worse compensated job.

Flights,"Sketchy interaction with Frontier on the phone? Hi all,

Firstly, I tried to read as much as possible on the sidebar, in the wiki, and in searches in this sub. I'm still really new to flying, but I've done it a couple times now post-COVID. The next three paragraphs are background info I think might be relevant. Skip to --- for the actual question. 

I was flying to Denver for a one-night concert on a Thursday and found a really cheap flight- $100 round trip and the times worked out perfectly. Then, another show got added Saturday, two days later, with an artist I really enjoy. The flights back Sunday were $80 instead of $50 on Friday, so still really cheap. 

I went to Frontier's website to change the return flight and saw that there was a $50 change fee. I tried to use their chat function to ask if cancelling the flight altogether and booking a whole new flight with the new dates was, perhaps, any cheaper (since I'm inexperienced in this). However, the chat feature wasn't working- I'd be in the queue for half an hour and it'd eventually tell me that no one was available. I tried that all morning.

Actually, there's two chat features, but one simply never pops up- flyfrontier.com/chat-with-us/ -I tried different browsers and turning off VPN and nothing worked. I used the flyfrontier.custhelp.com/app/chat/chat_launch page. That's the one where I was in queue endlessly. 

---Eventually I called the number listed on the chat page- they say it's a Web Help Desk. This is the sketchy part. I was just calling to ask if it'd be cheaper to cancel the flight or to change it online. He was saying that he could book my flight for ~$300, and I was saying that I didn't need a whole new flight, just looking for information. He then put me on hold and told me his manager said he could give me the flight change for ~$200. I told him, politely, that I saw it for far cheaper on the website and I'd do it there. He put me on a quick hold again and then told me that he could cancel my flight for me, which I told him I didn't really want to do. I told him to have a nice holiday season and that I'd do it on my own online. 

Then he called me back! I've never had that happen from any customer service person *ever*. Ever. He called me and told me that he could change my flight for $99. Again, cheaper to do it online. I just hung up at that point. 

Was this a scam? Does he actually work for Frontier? I had to tell him which airline I was flying with so I'm wondering if this is some third party. Do they make money off the top from people desperate to talk to someone? Or maybe from elderly people who don't know how to use chat functions? I saw somewhere that Frontier doesn't have a call center anymore, so I'm thinking that one of those options is it. But like, how do they get away with something that's so blatantly scammy? Is this normal?

     The flight was to depart at 22:20 in zanzibar and it did so for a quick flight to pick up/ drop off passengers in dar es salaam.  We arrive and passengers left and got on when we were supposed to leave 1+ hour after the captain announced that they have a leak in the plane’s tire and they need to replace it. After another hour he said that they located a tire and they were in the process of repair. After another hour they announced that tire is the wrong tire and they cannot fly. After another 1+ hour they announced they announced that they need permission to exit the plane.

         So here is the kicker, during the waiting of the deplaning KLM assured us that they would be finding accommodations for passengers or compensate passengers who can do it themselves. So at 04:00 we deplaned and had to go into a line of 200+ people to go through customs to grab our bags. 5-6 hours of going no where.

    After we exited customs we were met with an agent who handed us a sheet of paper stating in short “we could not find any accommodations for you you need to figure it out for yourself.”

     As the plot thickens klm has no customer service line we finally found a hotel at 07:00  slept for 5 hours. My wife managed to contact a agent via text WhatsApp and they said they couldn’t help us. 

Currently I acquired a SIM card to call the Tanzanian office to which no answer from them called by myself and the airport authority.  It sits at 15:35 no remarks or emails from klm. 

TL:DR. KLM dropped us off in a random city at 4 am and pretty much ghosted us."

After sitting on the tarmac for an hour, it was announced that there was a mechanical issue that could not be fixed without powering down the jet. So all 350 passengers headed back to the waiting lounge - where we stayed for the next six hours. The seriously undermanned Qatar Airways staff appeared to have been instructed by the Doha HQ not to make any definitive announcements about the flight status, much to the ire of passengers who bombarded the poor staff member en masse with all kinds of questions and hollers. 

Eventually, the engineering team gave up fixing the plane at close to 0230 in the morning. But it was never announced that that flight as cancelled, probably due to liability reasons. The airline did pay for hotels and transport of all 350 passengers and arranged alternative trips on different airlines.

It’s never happened to me before so I’m curious - what is the airline SOP for such situations? Like is there a maximum time given to fix the plane before declaring game over? It seemed Doha was adamant that the flight not get cancelled even as the wait dragged the four hour mark."

Flights,"851 CAD fee to rebook flight that couldn't be taken due to COVID travel restrictions (booked through flightnetwork). Does such a high fee make sense? Me and two friends bought tickets from Canada to Japan and Korea in November 2021 for May 2022 and were unable to travel due to COVID restrictions in Japan in May (tourists were not allowed to enter the country at the time). Because we were unable to travel, flightnetwork converted our tickets to ""open tickets"" that could be used as credit towards booking the same destinations in the future. We are trying to do that booking now, and using flightnetwork we can see that tickets now cost roughly 100 CAD more than what we originally payed (we payed 1550 CAD, tickets now are roughly 1650 CAD). What we expected is that we would have to pay this difference, probably with some fee to flightnetwork as well. After calling flightnetwork, we were informed that the price difference we'd have to pay is 851 CAD with flightnetwork's handling fee being 20 CAD and the rest being 831 CAD that has to be payed to the airlines. My question is whether this 831 CAD fee makes any sense? Would an airline ever charge such a high fee? We are essentially just buying a new ticket with credit through flightnetwork so I'm very confused. Airlines are Air Canada and Asiana Airlines.

Let this be a PSA that flightnetwork is terrible to deal with, we understand now we shouldn't have booked with them in the first place."
Flights,"Flight Porto-Malaga: separate tickets/reservations or not? I want to book a return ticket from Porto to Malaga. When I searched the dates I want on Skyscanner, the best option for me is to go Porto-&gt;Madrid, and than Madrid-&gt;Malaga, while the best return flight is a direct one from Malaga to Porto. Thus, my trip would include three flights, and Skyscanner provides two options: with separate reservations or without sepate reservations (the latter is via Kiwi and is 20 euros more expensive) \[I added a screenshot showing this\]. The third option I see here is that I buy all three tickets completely separately. The price is almost the same for buying separate tickets, or buying them combined but with separate resevation (I don't really understand the difference..); only the Kiwi one without separate reservations is 20 euros more. Which option do you think is best? I hope I managed to explain this in an understandable way; I'm not (yet) a frequent flier so I don't understand exactly how this all works."

Recently Blueair has stopped putting out flights and me and my girlfriend had our flights canceled with no mention on how to get a refund. I've done some research and of course it seems Blueair is nearing bankruptcy, and I found absolutelyno way of contacting them.

I found that you can use a 3rd party to do the stuff for you, and they take 25-30% commission. I'm fine with that but I am unsure as to which 3rd party to use. I've seen AirAdvisor and 3FlightDelay, all of which have mixed to pretty good reviews, but they require stuff like ID and bank account number (if I rememer correctly). I'm just not sure about these kind of things, and I don't wanna be a part of a scam or identity theft obviously.

So anyway my question is, which 3rd party to use? Thanks in advance."

This July I booked a flight through expedia with SAS. Of course the pilot strike resulted in a lot of cancelled flights, including my return trip.

Expedia/SAS offered me an alternative return trip which was several days later and didn't fit my travel plans. I called to instead process a refund, which the agent said he initiated. I then organised my own return travel.

I have been attempting to get a refund processed since then, with SAS and expedia both saying I need to contact the other company. SAS then further claims that as they offered me alternative flights I am not due a refund.

I could really use some advice, as this is driving me absolutely crazy.

Flights,"Is there a way to skip my first flight without being labeled no-show? So I'm going back home from Japan next month and will be in Tokyo at that time. My flight here was to Nagoya (with a layover in Tokyo) and since I booked a round-trip my tickets back start from there as well. 
I was planning on canceling or skipping the flight from Nagoya so I don't have to go back and forth to Tokyo. On top of this, my flight home was canceled and the only option I got resulted in a 12 hour layover in Tokyo + an airport change. Going back to Nagoya would make my trip home a whole day longer than intended and increadibly inconvenient.

The site I booked the tickets from is telling me it's impossible to cancel the flight from Nayoya and if I don't show up, I will be labeled ""no-show"" and the connecting flight will be canceled as well. 

Does anyone know a way around this or have similar experience? If I contact the airline directly and tell them I won't be there, will that solve it? Since I have to change from domestic to international flight the luggage shouldn't be a problem since I'll have to check out in Tokyo regardless.

&amp;#x200B;

first of all sorry if this post doesn't belong here but I tried to get as much info as I can but it gets really confusing after a while.

&amp;#x200B;

I try to travel to Japan through Seoul. I will fly from WAW on 28.04 and it should land at ICN at 06:25 the next day. The airports I consider to fly to are KIX or FUK(both of them are ok as I want to go specifically to Hiroshima).

&amp;#x200B;

I thought about taking the flight from ICN to FUK at 08:55 as it is Asiana Airways(OZ) and I have read they have codeshare agreement with LOT airlines(LO) - so even on separate tickets I should be able to have luggage transfer done by airlines, right?

Here comes the question- with this conditions is this reasonable to choose this flight or should I just take one at 14:05 to KIX?

Last Monday(11/21) I was supposed to be on AA flight 1921 from San Jose, CA to Charlotte.  I was connecting to a final destination in Fort Lauderdale. The flight was supposed to take off at 10:15 PM. The flight was eventually delayed til 11:00 AM the following day.

The desk by the gate was able to book me on an earlier flight the next day. It being midnight by the time I talked to them and there being no trains available back to my house I asked for a hotel. The women working the desk went and talked to her manager and when returned told me to book the hotel, go sleep, and email American customer support for a refund. 

I have reached out to American Airlines for the refund and their response was:

&gt;	Thank you for contacting Customer Relations. I am happy to respond to your inquiry regarding your hotel reimbursement. Please accept my sincerest apologies for the overnight delay you experienced. However, we do not provide hotel accommodations when a flight's delay happen in your originating city. In these situations, we may be able to offer a discount through an email that gives customers the option to shop for a room themselves. With this in mind, I must decline your request for hotel reimbursement. I regret any disappointment this may have caused.

&gt;	I'm sorry to hear that you're disappointed with our response. Although we recognize that we may not always agree upon a resolution, we do our best to be supportive as advocates for our customers.  I regret that you were given incorrect information, however, we do not provide reimbursement for a scenario such as this one. 

&gt;	I appreciate the time you've taken to share your feedback with us. Please be assured that we take all of our customers' concerns and feedback seriously. The comments that you shared with me today will be made available to our leadership team for further review and will be used to refine and update our practices.

I'm planning on flying from Austin, Texas to Los Angeles, then LAX to Tokyo for a trip to Japan starting March 6th, 2023 until March 24th, 2023.

I'm going AUS to LAX through Southwest because it'll essentially be free with my Southwest points. Then LA to Tokyo through United Airlines, because that's a hell of a lot cheaper than directly from Austin to Tokyo, which would definitely require a layover anyway. I have Untied points as well so this seems like the cheapest option.

What's the average time to get from one gate to the other gate in LAX? This will more than likely be around 11 to noon on a Monday. So a busy time no doubt. Plus it'll arrive in domestic and I'll need to go to international correct?

I've heard about 3 hours for international flights, but I've only heard that for people flying international from their home city's airport. If I'm already past security, will it be faster? Or will I have to leave security and go through it again?

A set of flights I'm looking at lands in LAX March 6th, 2023 at 11:00am and the flight leaving LAX to Tokyo leaves the same day at 12:45pm. Seems pretty tight to me, but if being past security will save a lot of time, maybe it's not a huge deal. Or maybe I'll have to go through security again and it won't be enough time.

But I am worried about my baggage making it on my flights as well as myself in Detroit, it's an airport I've never had to fly through and both connections give very little time for ground staff to move my bag to the other plane, especially with it being winter in the north.

Essentially, my only options are to risk the short connections or leave a day early and have a 23 hour layover in Amsterdam. I'm currently gearing towards the rather long Amsterdam layover.

Which option would you all pick?"

Flights,"What airline loyalty program should I use if my airport is MIA? I have status on Delta but ever since moving to MIA I never fly with them, and want to try and get status elsewhere. I have the Jetblue card and was racking up points there because I was going to BDL a lot, but now I'm more focused on LAX and NYC so feel like American and United would be better options.

Details:

* Mostly flying to LAX and NYC, 2-3x/quarter
* Sometimes BDL, 1x/quarter
* Definitely traveling internationally (EU, SA, hopefully Asia someday) 1-2x/year.
* I don't fly 24/7 so will prob want the program with the lower barrier to entry to get onto the bottom rung.

The American v United debate seems like a miserable race to the bottom. So which one is the lesser of two evils if MIA is your main airport?"

It gets worse though. Turkish rebooked me to a flight on Ethiopian Air, who decided to load the entire undercarriage with cargo leaving no room for checked bags like mine. Now it's the morning of the wedding I'm attending, and my suit (as well as all my other clothing) is still in Turkey.

Now, they've rescheduled me to a flight several days after the original. I don't have the patience or time to deal with this right now as we'll be away from wifi and cell service for the next few hours. Other flights are significantly more expensive than they were, but calling into Turkish help lines I get the response ""Call centers are too busy to take your call, try again later"".

Never get the simple or lowest economy as it is often impossible to change, cancel or even upgrade it (that's what lastminute sells but they don't tell you). In some cases there's no luggage and lastminute either don't tell you, or want twice the price to add luggage with no refund or 90% less...

I've seen a lot of posts about resolving issues with flights leaving Europe but not as many about flights going from the U.S. to Europe. I had reservations for a flight leaving the U.S. on November 11th. On October 31st I got an email saying, ""Re-routing by Flight cancelation or missed connection,"" and it turns out they took us off of our original flight and put us on a flight a whole day later, taking an entire day and night from our trip in our destination and costing us a night's accommodation we had already paid for and couldn't get back. We looked into what Airhelp could do, and when we entered our flight information, it said our original flight left on time without any problems. Our trip was two legs, and we entered the information for both legs and Airhelp said both flights were showing up in their system as fine and with no problems. No compensation was offered to us by TAP. I already have a complaint pending through TAP's website and did receive a confirmation email from them with a ""reference"" or ""contact"" number. I've seen advice given about going through the EU regulator because of a law they have, but I also saw that the EU law only covers flights leaving Europe, not flights going into Europe. My flight was going into Europe. Do I have any other avenues for recourse besides just going through the airline's own complaint process and waiting to hear back from them? We have travel insurance through our credit card, so we're considering filing a claim through that. Is there anything else? Calling them out on social media? I couldn't find a complaint process for Star Alliance, but are there any other places where I can file a complaint? Thanks so much for any insight you can give."

Flights,"Anyone have experience with Sharjah Airport, UAE? Is a 40 minute layover there insane? I'm looking to travel from Yerevan, Armenia, to Almaty, Kazakhstan, and back in January, but the only really affordable flight is via Air Arabia with layovers at Sharjah Airport. The trip there is fine with a 6 hour layover, but all the return flights only give me 40 minutes. If I wanted to take two days and pay six times as much I could deal with two layovers in Frankfurt and Astana, but I don't really have that time or money. Any advice? It looks like a small airport with only one airstrip, but I don't know what sort of customs they might have."

The lady at the gate was extremely rude upon seeing me approach with a hard-shell encased guitar and a soft case containing 2 guitars. They DESTROYED my internal electronics. None of my 2 guitars and bass work properly now. I went to switch between the bridge and neck pickups and I have no signal on my neck and buzzing on my bridge. Clearly they went inside and tampered with the wiring. Whatever clown that was working that night clearly didn't care at all for what they were doing. I didn't notice until 2 weeks after I landed that my stuff was damaged and my pedalboard is missing numerous screws and washers. Idc what they say next time, either they'll let me carry on and put it in a closet or I'm not boarding. They gave me a voucher for $150 when they did way more than that to my Gibson. This person stripped a screw on my Midtown and my Mustang Bass. Even after their public past of damaging instruments, they show no mercy unless you lawyer up."

I got the passport in 2018, since then I've lost about 75 lbs and have a beard now. She asked for another ID to verify, no problem handed her my TN Drivers license. DL is from 2021, I've lost 30 lbs since then and  have a beard now. 

I get it, I look a little different. She had an issue with both IDs still, even though all the information matches. She had to get someone who I assume was a supervisor.

They didn't even bother to scan them to confirm they were real until after she spent 3 minutes staring at me and the IDs to determine I in fact was the guy in the picture. I've flown probably half a dozen times with that passport including when I flew to IAH two days ago, no issues. 


My question is, where would that have gone if they just refused to believe it was me. What else could I possibly do to prove my identity when I've handed them my US Government issued passport, my TN state issued ID and I've gone through the TSA precheck process in the last year."

Flights,"Horrible Travel Experience with British Airways and Lufthansa - Need Advice (Long I'm sorry) I was traveling from Austin to Berlin for a work trip and ended up having the worst travel experience of my life and now I really need help on how to proceed.

Before my travel even began, I tried many times to check in online, but never was able to until I received a new booking/reference number in my email which I never requested in the first place. I was able to check into that **first** flight but not the second from LHR--&gt;BER. I decided to ask the BA folks at the gate in Austin to manually check me in instead. 

My initial travel plan was to fly AUS--&gt;LHR--&gt;BER with a 1hr 20 min layover in LHR (note: this was booked through my job so I didn't really have control over this layover timing). I arrive at the gate and ask them about this second flight. They check my two reference numbers and tell me that due to a double booking they cannot check me in. They call LHR and ask for what to do and they tell them to have me check in at the gate in LHR. I ask if this is fine since my lay over is short and they say yes.

My first flight was BA190 scheduled for 6:25pm on 9/18. It was delayed 40 minutes causing me to arrive in LHR with a 40 minute layover. Upon landing, you have to go through security again even if you're connecting but in order to do this you need a **boarding pass,** which I did not have since I was not checked in. I start freaking out and ask some security lady what's going on and she is able to check some online portal and she tells me I was **removed from the flight** and she cannot provide me an explanation. She tells me even if she could fix it, I was too late to check-in in the first place since it has to be done 60-90 min before the actual flight takes off. The customer service lady tells me there are no other flights today to go to BER and my best option is to either wait till tomorrow, or have them rebook me on another airline (Lufthansa) 5 hours from now to take me to Munich (MUC) and then have a layover of 50 min there before flying to BER. I take that option and decide to wait it out. This concludes the mess from BA. 

Next, I'm waiting for the LH2497 (5:50-8:40pm), and its also delayed 40 minutes due to air restriction for the Queen's funeral happening where no planes could fly overhead. The pilot is super kind and tells us he's going to call all the gates in MUC and ask them to hold for us. He is actually able to do this and all seems to be ok, but he tells us still to rush. When we land, we all have to go through immigration again and sprint to our gates. When I get to mine, everyone is yelling and apparently they overbooked the flight **severely** and looks like maybe 20 ppl are bumped. This was for LH1960 and I was actually checked in this time with an assigned seat number. I asked them what was going on and they said it was an accident and to go to customer service. Customer service told me that there was nothing else today (it was like 10:30pm) and there's no empty flights tomorrow either. They tell me my only option is to have me be No. 1 on standby for the 7am flight the next day. I end up taking that option and somehow squeeze on in the morning.

After this mess I filed claims with both airlines. British airways offered me an e-voucher of 100£ and Lufthansa offered me 250EUR. This just feels like a slap in the face and I want to escalate these claims but have literally no knowledge of the laws that I would need to know.

I've tried to look up laws but my case seems so random and uncommon and I'm at a loss. The whole ordeal drained me so much, and I would really appreciate any help. 

TLDR; I was double booked on two BA flights and then removed. Was then switched to Lufthansa with an additional layover and then bumped due to overbooking."

Flights,"Flight Change Scam? Bought an international ticket for family through AA, they filled out all the details, I just paid. Along with the ticket price was TRAVEL ASSIST 888-2471314 CA, which I assumed was to allow family member to change flight if needed.

Just got charged $75.00 a month and a half later through EROS TOURS AND TRAVEL. Looking it up, it has horrible reviews and quite a few have fallen to this tactic. Family member calls, they explain it was because the flight number changed (an involuntary decision on family members part), and it was written down in fine print. 

I'm trying to ask family member to email me the fine print for the travelers assist, but is this a common tactic? Why would a flight number change, or even a 7 minute time change on the airlines behalf (per google reviews) trigger the processing fee? Wouldn't that lead to flight number/time changes just to profit off the process fee?

My idea:

Book the round trip at $2600 and book a separate flight to travel to from OSL to LHR (about $200) before my return flight. This in total save me about $1800."

I'll cut a very long story short as it's gone on for so long, and has been absolutely infuriating - countless hours on the phone to Lufthansa (and Expedia, who can't help), sending emails, and so on. 

My flight to Australia is meant to be in 3 weeks, on 3 December. It's not yet ticketed, and the money hasn't been taken out of my account. I've spoken to them on the phone several times, sent emails, and have basically been going around in circles for weeks. I keep getting told it's ""in the queue"" to be ticketed, and that they're going to do it ASAP, etc. And...nothing. 

At this point, I'm thinking that something is really wrong. But when I am able to get hold of them, I get no answers and just promises that they'll get them ticketed.

Then I requested the EC261 compensation on EasyJet, which they say they pay within a month. 2 months go by and nothing so I called them and asked them what's up. They said it is approved but they just need to authorize the payment and to wait a bit. So I wait, call them again and repeat the cycle few times. After a while they told me the payment was authorized and I would receive it within 2 weeks. I didnt receive it so I called them again and they said they never sent it. Now at that point I figured they will keep lying to me so I started writing them emails instead so I can have a proof of the conversations. In those emails, they already told me twice that they sent the money but when I asked them to send me proof of payment, they always back out and tell me they didnt authorize it yet. 

So I have 2 questions:

1. Is there a deadline the airlines have to pay the EC261 compensation? It has been over 5 months
2. Can I legally hold them accountable for lying to me on multiple occasions when I have proof?"

Kiwi says you can also deal directly with the airline carrier!

Fuck Kiwi, lets chat with Flair!
I can pastebin a redacted version but here's the online chat with Flair take away points, keeping in mind that I'm paraphrasing an agent that was dumber than a sack of rocks :
- kiwi booked 3 separate reservation
- flight change is : reservation difference + 29cad change fee + tax
- flight cancellation credit is : initial fare price - 40cad cancellation fee + tax)
- chat lady tells me flight 1 change's fare is 62$ + 29 change fee + tax, initial reservation was 99cad. 
- ""cool beans, proceed""
- balance due : 46$ , ""pardon? 62 + 29 + tax - 99$ = 46$?""
- turns out new flight is 145 : 62 + 29 [+ 25 airport improvement fee AGAIN + 7 security atsc + 15 call center fee] + tax
- cancellation on flights 2 and 3 respectively give [59 initial fare - 40 cancellation fee - taxes = 14$ credit][49 - 40 - taxes = 4$ credit]
- I asked the agent to undo the changes because she hid the fees and hinted at 62+29+tax which is far from 145 total. she left chat.

Call to flair
- give my reservation number, asked if I want to pay the balance.
- tell her about the chat lady, ask to fix this mess.
- told they cant do changes without security question : email on reservation (that is kiwi's secret, they refuse to give it to me)
- ask to escalate, told they cant escalate until I pass security question.

Call to kiwi
- call the kiwi phone number on eticket
- robot asks for booking number, cheers
- robot asks for birth date, refuses to validate my birth date (I know my birth date thank you)
- robot hangs up

Chat to kiwi
- refuses to give me email on reservation
- tells to call phone # on e ticket
- tells me my own birthday :)

Next step :
I am honestly considering just calling Visa and disputing the 5 tickets I have pending with kiwi, and rebooking them without OTA, but still with flair because, prices.
All this while trying to shop for a long distance mover that has more than 1.5 stars rating/reviews for a 5k km move across Canada in December.
Thanks for coming to my TED talk/rant, will update when I have new information.

tl;dr kiwi is fine as long as you don't need actual customer service and flair chat ladies are dumb and long distance movers are all scams."
Flights,Minor name spelling error on Air Canada flight ticket. 
Flights,"Lufthansa - Legal Advice Hi All,  
Searching for legal advice on next steps- England, UK

Paid £2100 for a Lufthansa return ticket via Amex Credit Card  
London City &gt; Frankfurt (transit) &gt; Hong Kong (Sept)  
Hong Kong &gt; Zurich  &gt; London (Nov)

The outbound flight was cancelled an hour before the flight whilst my parents were at the airport.  Eventually Lufthansa arranged a hotel + a new ticket with Cathay Pacific and they arrived in Hong Kong around +30hrs later.

I reached out to Lufthansa for compensation due to the delays as I believe I'm entitled to £500\~ per passenger.  They claimed the flight was cancelled due to severe weather causing the airport to close which is out of their control.  Looking at flight tracker, there were flights in and out of both London City and Frankfurt at the time of the flight.    I also noticed that the plane they were due to board left Frankfurt on time, but did a U-turn  half way and landed back at Frankfurt.  Therefore the plane they were supposed to board never arrived.  
Am I in the right, thinking that I'm due compensation?  Due to the HK requirements, we had to reschedule quarantine hotels + PCR tests.

To top it all off, I've looked at the return flights for November and I've noticed they had disappeared from the booking system.  After numerous calls to Lufthansa, apparently a refund was requested and they returned £100.  

I've tried calling them multiple times, however they are of no help.

Do I keep pursuing for compensation?  Do I reach out to Amex for help?  
The outcome I would like is to recoup as much compensation as possible or increase my refund cost so I can simply book another return flight from another airline.

Thanks in advance"

Flights,"Is 2hr 55m enough for a domestic to international layover with different airlines? Hey y’all, I’m planning a trip from ATL-LAX-Tokyo, taking Delta from ATL-LAX and then Singapore airlines from LAX to Tokyo. 

The reason I don’t just want to fly to Tokyo directly is because I’ve never flown in a 757 before and I really want to experience it once in my life.

However, the earliest 757 delta flight from ATL-LAX is supposedly (according to Delta’s site) from 0950 eastern to 1125 western time. The sq flight departs at 1420 western time.

So would 2hr55m be enough for me to deplane, get my baggage, re-check in with SQ, clear security, and all that? (Do let me know what else I’m missing here, I’m not American if that helps)

Flights,"Lynx doesn't want to refund me Hello there! I would really appreciate if you guys have any helpful info.

We had a situation last Monday, my wife and I had tickets for a concert in Vancouver that was starting at 8pm (PST). So, we were traveling from Calgary to Vancouver, using Lynx, leaving 6:05pm (MST) and arriving 6:15pm (PST). 
They delayed the flight for 15 min, which was not a big deal, but then later when we were on board (which was around 6:00pm), the crew announced that there was a failure with a valve, so they were waiting for an engineer to do the inspection which took around 1hr and 20 min.
After that long waiting, they decided to switching planes was a better idea.
So, by the time we were back in the airport, it was 7:45pm, and we were more than convinced that we wouldn't make it to the concert. 
We decided not to board the second plane, let know the lynx personal and try to explain them the situation, but the only answer we got there was ""I don't work for Lynx"".
The second plane ended up leaving around 8:50pm (MST), probably we'll make to the concert but just the last songs if we were lucky.

My wife called customer service yesterday and they said they can't refund because it was safety related issue and also because they offered a second plane in the time frame marked in the policy, (which I can't find).

I didn't pay insurance for that flight (my error) but not sure because of this specific situation which was a aircraft failure, will be any chances of getting a refund or credit at least?

Thanks for the reading and your future answers!"

Hi, this is a crazy post and I know it but crazy things happen all the time in the world so I thought why not? right?

So yeah, here's the thing. I'm going to spend December 24th and 31th alone for the first time in my life. My mom died 4 years ago and slowly all friends have disappeared.

I live in a very boring city where nothing happens. I have USA Tourist Visa and can stay for December with someone generous enough to get me a flight and spend December together as friends.
I'm a very changeable person so at one moment i'd love to be reading poetry with u and watching something and then maybe i'd be down to a party or visit friends if u'd like. 

I'm kind, compassionate, emotional, adventurous, impulsive to a fault. I like laughing and spending quality time with friends. I love talking about series such as Bojack Horseman, and listening to Funk Jazz in my free time. I'm a good friend to have around.

I'd do be down to try to have some new company in the lonely December time, get to me :) maybe we can chat a bit and be if we can be friends and have good times in ur city or travel around usa together.

I'm open to new experiences. I'm looking for someone who also is. Maybe this is too unrealistic and crazy but whatever"

Novemeber 5th westjet had some IT issues that resulted in my partents spending 6 hours at the air port to have their flight cancelled. They are then moved to a flight on monday..... This is where things get really bad.  


Monday the initial flight to calgary that is a connecting flight is delayed. This then results in 8 hours of waiting at the airport to get to calgary for 2am. From there it's waiting in a queue to get a new flight booked from calgary to vancouver. Parents finally get to the front of the line at 8am and then have a flight booked to a another near by city as there was no way to get to vancouver before midnight. So they are set to arrive at abbotsford for 7pm...... This flight is then delayed...... and the planes need to be switched.

Flights,"Question: my wife was denied to flight when she was boarding due to the country of destination required COVID test. my wife had an international flight from the US to her home country. Due to an allergic reaction to COVID vaccine she only got one shot. While doing the check in she presented prof of her first vaccination, and a waiver (note) from our primary care physician. The person at the counter accepted the documents and checked her luggage. All went as expected when 2 minutes before start boarding the plane she got denied to flight due to her incomplete vaccination records and the lack of COVID test (the requirements to enter the country was 1) fully vaccinated or 2) negative COVID test)

I understand that is up to the passenger to know what are requirements to enter a different country. But I’m wondering what degree of responsibility the airline has. They should not have allowed her to do the check in in the first place, and moreover if she would had the information necessary at the counter she would have had plenty of time to get her tested (the testing site was literally next to the counter)

The results of this was she missed a ver important familiar event.

Flights,"Honest review of Flair return flight to LAX Flair just started their LAX flights a week ago and this is my first 'real' time flying Flair. The first time I tried to fly them, they canceled the flight due to weather disruption, and it was a pain trying to get a refund, but that was mainly due to gotogate rather than Flair.

I booked online and paid for a checked baggage, and the fare was still 30% cheaper than alternatives. I had my doubts, but went ahead anyway. I tried to purchase their upgraded seat online and it failed again and again; their website had a problem. I tried to check in and it kept saying I need to do it in person; some Googling revealed Flair cannot handle assigning seats for multi-person bookings and you must do it in person. So I showed up to the airport nice and early, expecting a catastrophe. Luckily, no other flights were going out and they had multiple counters handling the line, and we checked in our luggage in 10 minutes. The flight was delayed an hour due to staffing issues, but they made up time during the flight and we arrived only 30 minutes past the scheduled landing time. I was very happy, overall. The 'larger seats' were basically a bit larger than standard seats on other airlines.

Coming back was a bit different. They were disorganized within LAX, likely because they just started their flights a week ago. Their counte rdidn't even have a logo and we had to ask the airport staff. To make matters worse, there were. flights heading out at the same time and their counter only had 2 people; a huge lineup ensued and we lined up for about an hour to check in our luggage. NOT good. There was still a huge lineup behind us and I felt bad for those people. When we got to the counter, we had to wait for the other attendant to help us because their computer systems had an issue. We reserved 2 seats online, and these reservations went through, thank God. However - somehow TSA Preapproved did not appear on our boarding passes, and we had to go to regular security. All other airlines make this much, much easier and I have never had a problem with TSA Pre with any other airlines before - ever. Finally, we were about 90 minutes delayed but landed about 1 hour after scheduled arrival, which is also good. Planes were clean and new, seats were definitely a bit tighter.

Would I fly flair again? I would, but definitely not if I'm only saving $50-100 a person, and I would not take the regular, shorter seats for longer flights (longer than 4 hours). They seriously, seriously need to upgrade their technology and systems; the people waiting behind me told me how they tried to pay online several times and had to call in to book their flight tickets. I experienced check-in and payment issues, etc. The time I spent with Flair, vs other airlines, simply is not worth my time in savings. The 1 hour delays were not a big deal, to be honest. Staff were friendly and really tried to do their best, so I have nothing bad to say about their service. Their boarding procedure is faster and more efficient than other airlines, imo, because their priority is to get everyone on the plane as fast as possible vs making the 'privileged' members feel more special. The TSA Pre screw-up, for example, is a big deal for me because it could mean an extra 20-30 min. wait in security, and all the additional overhead in time really adds up. Thus I would not fly flair unless I'm saving a minimum over $150 or more per ticket with convenient flight times."

How does the layover work? I know that for international to domestic connections you have to collect the luggage and enter the US to then check-in and progress for the domestic leg.

Would I be able to get my checked baggage at Newark or will it be automatically put on the next connecting flight? It's a long layover if that makes a difference.

Flights,"KLM Denied Reimbursement For Own Reasonable Expenses In early September I flew with KLM from Peru to London via Amsterdam Schiphol. Unfortunately on arrival at Schiphol due to a three hour delay at security I missed my connection back to London. I checked with the KLM team at the airport and after considerable further delay was told that the only available flights were the next day and my flight was rebooked with a stayover.

I was also advised by staff in the airport and on the phone that KLM would reimburse me reasonable expenses due to the delay. I had this in writing from the airline though sadly do not have a copy of the original document. As such I booked an airport hotel and bought dinner/breakfast (in total this came to around £200). I have since attempted to claim these back online through KLMs official system. Yesterday, after two months, I received the below response denying my request. Essentially they are claiming they owe me nothing as the circumstances were outside their control, leaving me out of pocket.

Given the situation, can anyone advise me on my rights and what other steps I could take to reclaim this money?

Thanks for your help with this!


&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for the email dated 6 September 2022 regarding flight KL989 from Amsterdam to London on 5 September 2022. At the outset, I am sorry for the unintentional delay in responding to you and regret learning that you were unable to travel as planned.
&gt; 
&gt; I hope you are keeping safe and well in these difficult times.
&gt; 
&gt; As per our records, you were held up at the boarding gate due to extra security checks. Hence, you missed the flight mentioned above. As a result, you were rebooked on the next alternative flight, KL983, departing the following day. I can imagine the situation you and your fellow passenger experienced, which was unsettling at the time, and I, of course, sympathize.
&gt; 
&gt; I do acknowledge and realize the inconvenience you encountered on this occasion; I regret my inability to comment anything about the security checks as KLM does not have any control over the Airport security. It goes without saying that our staff is committed to assisting our passengers in every possible manner at any point in time.
&gt; 
&gt; Hence, In line with current legislation, such conditions are considered beyond the airline's control and do not entitle passengers to compensation and reimbursement. Thus, I respectfully decline your request for payment and refund of additional expenses.
&gt; 
&gt; Furthermore, as per your email, I am concerned to take note of your disappointment at the airport about the inadequate assistance offered to you in this instance. It goes without saying that our colleagues are committed to providing the best possible assistance on every occasion. It is inexcusable that you should have been confronted with anything else. Naturally, you expect our staff to provide the best possible service at every point, and we certainly strive to provide quality assistance to our customers.
&gt; 
&gt; I appreciate you taking the time to provide us with this valuable feedback, and we will use it to improve our service further.
&gt; 
&gt; Despite this unfortunate experience, we hope to see you on board our flights again soon.
&gt; 
&gt; Best regards,
&gt;

Flights,"Best way to spend 3x 39500 Emirates Skywards miles When my parents and I were on a vacation three years ago, our return flight with Emirates got cancelled and we received some goodwill miles. The balance on each of our Skywards accounts is 39500 miles. At the end of next month, 9500 miles will expire on one of my parents' account. We're located in Austria.

I understand that the best value for miles is purchasing upgrades. However, my parents won't be able to go on long-distance travel in the foreseeable future.

I could spend my personal miles by booking a VIE-DXB flight in Flex Economy and spend 39000 miles on upgrading to business class. However, I'm not that interested in a Dubai holiday. Alternatively, I could fly MXP-JFK and purchase an upgrade for the same amount of miles, which would interest me more. I do have a few more months until my miles begin to expiry.

For my parents' accounts I investigated three options:

Flights,Hows the Jet Airways flight from Amsterdam to New Delhi and back? 
Flights,"1 flight two different points of origin and the longer haul is €400 cheaper! What? Hi everyone, 

So I just came across something rather interesting and annoying at the same time. I was looking for flight tickets from Amsterdam to New Delhi for my summer vacation. 

I was on the Skyscanner app when this happened. I came across a KLM non stop flight from AMS to DEL which costs about €900 economy (which is already ridiculous considering I am trying to book two month ahead). Now, I came across a few posts on TripAdvisor that suggested AMS is always very expensive to fly from. Taking this into account and the fact that I live close to the border of Germany I took a look at flights from Frankfurt (closest international airport). There were better deals with Lufthansa until to my surprise, there was a KLM flight to New Delhi via Amsterdam for €500! Upon closer inspection, I found out that the flight from Amsterdam to Delhi was the same flight!!!!!!!!(same date, same time and same duration). 

What is this sorcery? What is going on? Someone care to explain how this is remotely even possible, when the FRA-AMS-DEL is definitely a longer haul than the AMS-DEL. Are airlines now charging for time and not distance/fuel? The fact that it is a €400 difference was just too a big shock to me. Now I plan to take a train to Germany from The Netherlands and then fly back to The Netherlands and then fly to India. Hahahaha! This just really got me intrigued and hence my first post on my first account on Reddit! Cheers. "

Flights,"Tips requested: FRA to Punta Cana (optionally via South Florida) Hi all,

Need some advice on an itinerary for December \- Frankfurt to Punta Cana. Approx. dates: 17\-24 Dec.

Currently I see flights in the range of **750 EUR** \(Swiss/Edelweiss and Air\-France, which I would like to avoid\). Direct flights by Condor \(FRA\) and Eurowings \(Cologne\) seem more expensive.

Questions: 

1. Any experience in booking such flights? Can I expect prices to drop 2\-4 months before December?
2. I am also considering a week's trip to Florida by flying in to Miami / South FL first and then going to Punta Cana later. I see Miami return flights in the range of **650 EUR** \(TAP, Iberia\), plus return flights from South\-FL to Punta Cana around **300** bucks \(Jet\-Blue/AA\).
3. Will I be better off booking 3 one\-way flights as per: **FRA\-\&gt;Florida\-\&gt;PuntaCana\-\&gt;FRA**? This would need a bit of creativity.

Thanks in advance for your tips."

I have a ticket to see Peru v France in Russia at the World Cup and didn't make my travel arrangements soon enough, so I had assumed I wouldn't be able to go. But lo and behold, the travel gods have smiled, and it looks like I can make an affordable trip out of this after all. Obviously it will involve several connections and different airlines, but it seems very doable. Im looking to [r/travel](https://www.reddit.com/r/travel) for any advice info you might have about these different airlines, airports, or tips you'd be willing to impart!

The itinerary would be as follows:

Depart NYC \- Arrive London Gatwick, 6h10m layover in London, Depart London Heathrow, Arrive Helsinki, 2h55m layover in Helsinki, Depart Helsinki and arrive in Yekaterinburg Russia. All flights are on FinnAir.

Return leg is the same, but with a 23h layover in London.

My big questions are:

Is 6 hours enough time to transfer between London Gatwick and London Heathrow?

Is FinnAir reliable \(as much as any airline can be\), in as far as the flights are generally on time/not cancelled/overbooked/etc?

For reference, I will be traveling myself, with no checked baggage.

TL;DR \- Is 6 hours enough time to transfer between London Gatwick and London Heathrow? Is FinnAir a terrible airline to use and should I avoid it all costs?

Thanks in advance for any info!!

EDIT: There is another itinerary that would leave 3 hour layovers in both Helsinki and London on both travel legs, but would avoid the transfer between London airports. I was sort of looking forward to the 23 hours in London to explore a bit, but could easily pick the second itinerary if anyone had serious reservations about transferring airports."

Flights,"Unique Travel Challenge Resorting to Reddit for Help Tehran - Mexico City **TL:DR** 
My parents are Iranian Citizen's and have a valid Visa to Mexico. They cannot have a layover of 6+ hours in an EU country which seems nearly impossible to do on their return flights. 
You can get creative and go through 5 stops, but I'm trying to avoid 60hrs in the air and $12k spent on airline tickets for 2 people. 

Travel Dates: Arrival in early July with a departure and return home in early August. 

**Full Story** 
My parents came to the U.S in the 70's. They spent close to 20 years here and both went to Kansas State. My dad got his PhD and my mother got her Masters here. 

Even when they were handing out green cards and citizenship's, my parents had every intention of moving back to Iran after graduating so they never applied for a green card. They wanted to do the noble thing of being back with family and contributing to their community so they ultimately moved back to Iran in the mid 90's.

Fast forward to 2018. My sister and I are both U.S. Citizen's and both working professionals. I live in San Diego, she lives in Brooklyn and my parents are in their 60's and about to retire. We applied for a visa and green card but both were declined due to Presidential Proclamation 9645 (The Travel Ban). 

Our only goal at this point is to have them come visit once, maybe twice a year. 

Since I live in San Diego, someone gave me the idea of having them fly down to Mexico and putting them in a place just south of the border like the Rosarito area. That way I can drive back and forth for work when needed and my company has been awesome enough to let me work remote for a few weeks. 

So my parents got a Mexican visa, made travel reservations and with the date coming quickly, I booked a month long rental before I ran out of good options. 

Today their travel agency told them that due to inflation (probably made even worst than normal due to the Nuclear Treaty going to crap), airlines will not accept Iranian money. They were told that they would have to get creative and book through somewhere like Dubai using USD/Euro and it would cost between $10 - $15k.

Bonus issue and one that I'm not familiar with: It seems like they won't approve a transit visa with everything going on in the world unless they find flights that have a layover of less than 6 hours if they go through any European Union Countries. I've been able to find options getting them to Mexico with a short layover, but none on the way back. 

I'm not trying to make this post a political one. I just want to find a way to get our family together for the first time since 2011. As far as I'm concerned, I'm fed up with both countries. Expected the issues from one, disappointed in the other. 

So here I am reaching out the creative minds of Redditors to see if any have a solution that can make this happen.

I'm going on vacation in Japan, leaving Portland, OR on Friday 10/12/18, returning Thursday 10/25/18. Best deal I could find was AS576, SQ11 to get there, and SQ12, AS441 to get home. Those same flights are priced at anywhere from $809 to $936 depending on what site I look at. Google Flights says $810, Skyscanner $813, ITA Matrix $880.

Can I expect these prices to go down a significant amount \(more than $50\) or should I book now? I'd really like the total flight cost to be under $800 if possible. About $950 is probably the absolute most I can pay.

I'm also trying to land in Japan as soon as possible, but I can't leave Portland any earlier than 5pm Thursday 10/11.

Flights,"When you can't take the first flight of a round-trip ticket I hope this won't be too convoluted. I had a flight booked from my city to my hometown for Memorial Day weekend to see my family. As it happened, my father ended up in the hospital earlier this month and I traveled right away to be home. I was on vacation at the time, so my trip was from an entirely different starting point/airline. Now I'm *already* in the place I was going to go for Memorial Day, and so won't be taking the inbound, upcoming flight. I did want to retain the return flight however, and I had heard that airlines usually cancel your entire reservation if you don't show for the first leg.

In advance and with a lot of trouble, and confirmation of the family health emergency, I was able to get them to change my ticket to just be the return flight (and no change fee or cancellation). It seems nonsensical to me that they would charge me $200 to supposedly change my itinerary when I'm simply not using part of what I already paid for, but I understand it happens. My question is this. If I hadn't decided to be honest with them and try to fix this in advance, and I had simply *checked in online and gotten a boarding pass* for the first leg, but not showed up to the plane, would that have been enough to have the first leg register as ""taken""? After all, people miss flights for all kinds of reasons *after they have already checked in.*  I am very grateful the airline did the decent thing in a family emergency and realized I wasn't trying to scam them by purchasing a roundtrip etc.  It's just made me curious how exactly they know if a checked-in passenger hasn't taken a flight. Is it recorded at the gate that the BP wasn't scanned? Do FA's report back?

Finally this really makes me appreciate the flexibility of an airline like Southwest, where this can't happen. If you purchase something, you should get its value or be able to forgo some portion of its value. That's what purchase means. I just feel lucky that I was fully aware most airlines don't allow this."

* There are very cheap Ryanair/easyJet flights to London or Manchester \(if you book early\), but no direct flights to Nottingham.
* I guess I would have to take a bus \(or similar ways of transport\) to actually get to Nottingham. I know that London\-Stansted therefore isn't a very good choice, because you'd have to get to the city first \(time\-consuming and expensive\). I don't know about Manchester though.

 I initially was going to book through kiwi.com as the flights were so cheap but on further research both on reddit and Googling I discovered that it was quite an unreliable service that often left people stranded or declined them the adequate refunds that they promised in their kiwi.com guarantee.

The confirmation number is the right one; the phone # at least [seems to be legit](https://www.flyertalk.com/forum/united-airlines-mileageplus/1647821-check-your-ua-itineraries-schedule-changes-what-do-after-one-archive-73.html). I've called them today, and after some 10 mins of waiting loop, learnt that the forward leg (Jul 4) of my flight has been cancelled (the flight itself, or just my booking of it?) and that my only option is to book another flight (or the same one?) at a higher price. The whole idea struck me as strange and I dropped the call, suspecting a scam -- but checking the United website, I realized that the forward leg had indeed disappeared.

What are my options, and what is the best one? Can I just cancel the back leg as well and work with another carrier? (I could even try booking the same flight through Lufthansa, if it doesn't fall afoul of Fly America.) Is it normal for them to just cancel my booking? I don't have a ticket, just a ""printer-friendly purchase confirmation""; one thing that *might* have happened is that my script blocker has somehow messed up the booking process.

Also, is there a way to handle these things other than by phone?"
Flights,"In regards to the recent events with Southwest flights, has anyone noticed that flights are becoming any cheaper than normal? -"
Flights,"Southwest denied me an interesting request today. Wondering if this is normal? Should I have escalated higher. I'll try to be quick. I was cancelled out of Grand Rapids for a flight to Chicago to make a connection to the east coast. Anyway, I *In a panic* re-booked online for the earliest flight they had out of Grand Rapids tomorrow.

I then was like ""Well I can get to Chicago for the connection by car"". So I called SW and asked them basically to undo my rebook - give me my original seat/boarding pass back for the flight out of Midway, and they wouldn't do it (They offered to sell it to me for $200). I escalated to a supervisor that told me the exact same thing. ""I can't make up a fare. We don't offer a fare from Chicago for what you paid from grand rapids - even though you are connecting in Chicago"".

Is there some logic I am missing here? All I wanted was my original seat back. Did I need to escalate further to someone that can ""Make up a fare"" to give me a logical conclusion?"
Flights,"Help searching for a flight I plan on flying from (BOS)Boston to GYN(Goiania - Brazil) 3-8 months from now to visit my family. Flights are kinda expensive, ranging from 1000-1300$, but every once in a while I google random dates and I see a deal for 800$ish, although these dates are never what I'm looking for. 


I can arrive or leave on a weekday, but I want to spend 2 weekends over there.

What is the best way to catch a deal like this? Any specific company or website that would be better for me to keep an eye on? Any tips on better months to fly to South America?

Thank you!"

Flights,"Should I fly a return trip First and Premium Economy, or Business both ways? Thanks to some time saving up Avios, I'm now at a point where I'm looking at a long-haul holiday to burn through them. It's always been the plan to use it to reduce the cost of a premium seat as opposed to lots of short-haul trips (I've got good access to no-frills options for that). But, I'm wondering what the best way to play the redemption is.

I've always wanted to fly first class for the experience, but the option right now is to go first on the outbound and premium economy on the inbound leg, or to even out the redemption and go for business both ways.

Seeking advice whether first class redemption on BA is worth the stretch? All thoughts and opinions (even the constant 'BA Business is a dodgy product', although a well-trodden opinion, is still welcome)."

Flights,"Europe International Flight Cancelled Can I ask refund plus compensation? My flight was scheduled with flytap from Lisbon to Rio, Brasil.

Just a few hours ago, 26hours before the flight departure I received a message saying a ""flight change"" to leaving the next day 8h50 later arriving also 8h50 later then scheduled. My flight status on tap says cancelled.

They did not offer me the option of a refund or the new flight, just that sms message.

So I want to ask for compensation, and as I've read here I should send a complaint to their website asking for this saying that according to  EU 261 regulations Im entitled 600euros of compensation. \(thats max right? I've seen 400&amp;#37; the value of tickets but appears those are from outside EU\)

It should be [here](https://www.flytap.com/en-pt/support/complaint/personal-details) right? To file the complaint, and not in person

My question is, can I also ask for a refund of my ticket besides the compensation? Or will that interfeer with getting the compensation. I don't want to go to Rio on that new date.

If it does not affect, how do I proceed to cancel \(demand refund\) it? They gave me a number to call on email.

Should I first do the form complaint for compensation, and then call to cancel. Should I both cancel and ask for compensation on the complaint form \(although what happens if its not processed in time and I no longer can get refund?\).

Call to cancel to that number \(because if I try to cancel through website they charge me the 160euros tax on cancelled flights\) and also do the complaint through there?"

I'm flying out to Canada from Grand Rapids, Michigan. I have never flown to Canada, only having driven there from Detroit. I'm pretty excited and a bit nervous as this is my first solo, international flight. One thing that's bugging me is whether I have to grab my bags after every connecting flight. I've had connecting flights before but they were all domestic and usually with the same airline, so I never had a second thought about it. But now that I'm throwing in an international flight plus with multiple airlines I'm a bit puzzled and worried. 

From Grand Rapids to Chicago, I'm taking United. From Chicago to Toronto, I'm using Air Canada. From Toronto to Quebec City, I'm using Air Canada again. Do I have to grab my back when I land in Chicago and go through the same process again because of the change in airlines? How about when I land it Canada because of the whole customs thing?

Flights,"Question: Round Trip Ticket prices - longer than 1 month. I am preparing a trip home to America from Japan in July. I was hoping to stay in America for about 5 weeks.

However, when looking around at prices, I noticed that the price for a roundtrip ticket skyrockets if the trip is longer than 31 days. No matter what flight I look at, it's the same story. Any combination of start and end dates is cheap at the 31 day mark, and every single date past 31 days is waaaaay more expensive. 

For example, if I bought a ticket for July 16th-August 16th it's around 1,000 dollars. If I buy one for July 19th-August 19th, it's also about 1,000 dollars. However, if I buy a ticket for July 16th-August 19th, it's suddenly like 1,600 dollars. I can move the dates sooner and I can move them later. It's the same story. Dates within that 31 day time frame are cheap, and anything past that is expensive.

Is there a reason for this? I've never noticed it before. Why do roundtrip tickets get more expensive if the trip is longer than 31 days?"

Flights,"Is it too late to Contact Ethiad about an issue I've had with their airline? (Sidenote, never fly Ethiad. One of the worst experiences of my life. Seriously, they can go to hell) So back in November, I was planning a trip to India from Canada after completing my undergraduate. The flight was through Ethiad, whom I was told were a great airline.


The first leg was to Dublin, than from Dublin to Abu Dhabi and from Abu Dhabi to Delhi. 


The first two legs went okay, but when in Abu Dhabi, my boarding pass didn't have the actual information on it regarding my gate though it did have the terminal, and when I found a flight going to Delhi in that terminal, I asked an Ethiad employee if that was the correct flight and location and they said yes. Thus began hell. It wasn't the right flight.


I went to their customer service and they basically told me they couldnt do anything. I called Ethiad and they said because I missed this flight (that an Ethiad employee told me I was in the right place for and my boarding pass had the wrong terminal on), my entire return flight was also forfeit and I would have to buy entire new tickets at a whopping 300% of the cost I initially paid. To that I basically said f*** you, I don't even have that much money in my account as a newly graduated student.


What I ended up having to do was leave the actual terminal, go out to the sales desk and buy new tickets through another airline (Jet Airways to get me out of the customer service hell hole that is the Abu Dhabi airport, and a fantastically competent Ethiopian Airlines for my return trip.) I was basically out $700 because an employee looked at my boarding pass, destination and incorrect terminal and  told me to stay there. Not to mention they layover was really quite short too. And for the 30 some hours I was awake in this crapbasket of an airport, people made me walk from end to end to try to figure out a solution. I must have walked 50000 steps while being completely sleep deprived. I have never been so tired, and upset in that way before by the sheer stupidity of the situation, and the completely useless customer service. 


My ex girlfriend a month later would fly air canada back from BC and she had to be late for her flight because they greyhound was caught in bad weather, and they basically said ""okay cool, we'll reschedule you."" Seriously, screw ethiad right up the fetid butthole.


After was all said and done, I didn't really know who to respond to about this crazy issue. And now it's been months. I was on the phone for literally hours while in the Airport with expedia who also said the same thing, that they couldn't do anything because Ethiad was saying it was 100% my fault. 


**Is it too late to try to contact someone about this?** I'm honestly getting upset typing it out now haha.


If it's gone and I can't get anything back, that's fine. It would be nice though. One thing is for sure though, I will never in my life fly the garbage airline that is Ethiad again, and I encourage anyone that even is having the misfortune of considering it to do the same."
Flights,"United carry-on vs checked bag This is my first time flying since I was very young and I'm trying to get an idea of costs. If you go basic economy with United, you're not allowed to take carry-ons so you have to check it for 25 dollars each way if it's round trip, correct? If you go regular economy, and pay the extra 50 for the round trip and can take the bag as carryon, does that mean you no longer have to pay the check in cost? Is there any other baggage fees I'm not aware of?"

I've noticed that pretty much any flight you pop in when searching from Phoenix -&gt; elsewhere is leaps and bounds more expensive than flights from LAX -&gt; elsewhere. Yet flying from PHX to LAX is only $104 round trip. Unfortunately, no travel sites seem to automatically do this little price reduction, even if there are layovers in Dallas and other places. 

Are there any that do calculate it? Iceland for example from LAX is 380, or 900 from AZ. If I were to take a $100 flight to LAX then hop on a flight to Iceland I'd save a bunch.

She has circulation problems, is a bit overweight, is up in age. I think she wants first class, but she can't afford it. I plan to buy her ticket (unbeknownst to her) but first/biz would be a stretch. Looking at prices, it seems that buying three economy tickets for the two of us would be far cheaper than buying her a first/biz ticket and me an economy (much less first/biz for me too). This would give us a row to ourselves, perhaps allow her to prop her feet up a bit (or one leg at least), and have more room generally.
What does everyone think? Has anyone done this?
BTW, I'm aware of the points game. I do intend to get into it for miles, but for various reasons, it's probably not an option for the trip I'm talking about."

I have already tried contacting Trip.com as well as China Eastern Airlines to modify information but they said that they would not be able to change the passport numbers. Their reasoning was that more than 2 digits were incorrect.

Right now I have no way to change my passport number and I looked everywhere to see if there was a solution. I did read that tickets tend not to have the passport numbers printed on them. I was thinking about checking in at JFK airport and seeing if they would change it for me. Would this be a possible solution? All the other information on my passport matches with my ID so they should be able confirm my identity. If I were to do this, would there be an issue of boarding the plane as well as returning from an international trip?

Flights,"Canceling return flight for ""no cancellation fee"" tickets? Maybe a stupid question but I couldn't find an answer by searching.   

Some airlines have booking classes that allow refunds and don't charge any cancellation fee. When booking a round trip, I can select each leg seperately and I'm shown the price for each leg. So obviously when buying a round trip each leg is cheaper than buying the flights seperately.   
Now my question. The booking class allows cancellation without fees. So when I cancel my return flight (after consuming the first flight), will they refund the whole cost of the return flight or will they calculate what the single flight (that was consumed) would have cost and only refund the difference?  

For example:  A - B - A costs $300+$300 when booked together as a round trip but when booking only A - B it costs $500. Will they refund $300 or $100?  

This is the case with several airlines, I checked their website and conditions but couldn't find an answer."
Flights,"Booking longer concurrent/overlapping trips to save money on short trips I need to be in the US for a few very short midweek meetings this year, but the direct midweek return flights are very expensive (2200 GBP). If I stayed over a Saturday (as I normally do) it drops to below 800 GBP, as the airlines class it as a leisure flight.

I had a hack idea to book one trip with my outbound UK&gt;US flight for my July meeting and it's return flight for my US&gt;UK flight for my October meeting. Then another trip with the outbound as my US&gt;UK return flight in July, and its return flight as my UK&gt;US outbound flight in October.

Doing this, because both trips span weekends (many in fact), my total cost for both trips is 1600 GBP rather than 4400 GBP.

Are there any reasons why this wouldn't work? All I can think is to the airline (and maybe immigration) it would look like I was remaining in the US for a few months, but not sure that's a problem anyway. Also, I would be commencing the second trip while technically still on the first trip, but again, not sure that's an issue."

I have a dilemma. I will be in Belgium for a work trip this summer for two months. However, I want to depart from a different city and am searching for a cost effective method to do so. Here is the exact process I have in mind.

* Realistically I will fly from my home in the US (DFW) to CDG (Paris) or AMS (Amsterdam) because it's cheaper (according to own research) and easy &lt;1 day train to Brussels.
* Spend 2 months on work trip in Brussels
* At the end of my work trip I hope to take a short 1-week vacation (Baltics+Finland). I plan to fly from Brussels to Vilnius
* go overland from Vilnius to Helsinki
* Fly back: HEL -&gt; DFW

The issue is that it's much cheaper to book a round trip ticket than book two separate one-way tickets. I can't book a round trip ticket because I have different arrival/depart cities (arrive AMS, depart HEL). According to my research either:
* I bite the bullet and take the extra cost of two one way tickets
* book a round-trip DFW -&gt; AMS flight and fly HEL -&gt; AMS to catch my return flight

Any other options I might have missed, and any tips on how to approach this situation would be much appreciated :)

Flights,"Asking for an Icelandair refund Hello everyone

A couple days ago I bought a ticket from Denver \(CO\) to Paris \(France\) \(from the Norwegian airline\) on the 14th of may. I already had a round trip flight that I bought from Icelandair in summer 2017, but now I want to get at the very least a partial refund on that second part of the round trip ticket, the first part being was a round trip Paris\-Reykjavik\-Denver that I took in August 2017 and now the upcoming Denver\-Reykjavik\-Paris which got moved by icelandair to the 15th of May.  I want to take the second flight \(from the Norwegian\) which goes directly from Denver to Paris but I don't see how or where to ask for a refund on Icelandair's website and after some digging on forums I am still clueless. Should I contact Icelandair directly ? Or should I stick with icelandair and cancel my other flight ?

TL;DR How do I get a refund from Icelandair ?"

As of now there are plenty of available seats. We want to save some money, but we would prefer to sit next to each other. So my question is, how does that all work?

Flights,"Flight compensation with multiple delays by different companies I had booked a Lisbon-Helsinki flight by TAP Air Portugal last Saturday, but it was cancelled at a short notice (got the email while on my way to the airport). They gave me what they said was the first available replacement, which was two days later on Monday, included a transfer, and was on different airlines (SWISS from Lisbon to Zürich, then Finnair to Helsinki). Unfortunately, the SWISS flight was delayed enough that I missed the connection, had to spend a third delay night in Zürich, finally reaching Helsinki on Tuesday afternoon, about 56 hours late from my original schedule.

My main question is, can I apply for compensation from TAP for the first delay and from SWISS for the second one, or does it just count as one massive delay of the first flight? 

I know it might feel a bit greedy to apply for compensation twice, but these were really two unrelated incidents by two different operators. And after I had spent two additional nights in Lisbon, missed a day of work, and done some schedule rearrangements, getting another night's delay and doing the same thing all over again really ticked me off.

Update: the second flight has a TAP ticket number, so I cannot directly submit a complaint about it to SWISS even though they operated the flight (their complaints web form only accepts their ticket numbers).

Today I flew an airline I do not frequent and therefore boarded in zone 3. I had reserved a window seat because it is a 4 hr flight and I can zone out, lean against the window and sleep. 

By the time I got to my row someone was in my seat. We made eye contact and he opened with “I’m in seat B, but I’m already here so you’re okay with me taking the window right?”

I responded, “No, I would like my seat actually.”

Him: “Really dude?”

Me: “Yes I plan to sleep”

Then he begrudgingly got up and glared at me. 

Had it been an equal seat-to-seat swap or to help a family I might have considered my options, but I’m not going to give some guy my seat just because he got there 2 min earlier. 

The entire flight was awkward and I didn’t really get any sleep that I had been planning. 

My wife said a similar thing happened to her when she got upgraded to Delta Comfort+ and she also saw one woman get bullied by a guy in Comfort+ who all but demanded the woman give up her aisle seat because she was short. I didn’t know this was a strategy by middle seat fliers. "

So I am traveling from DRC to India in few days, while taking gifts to my friends and family is something. I want to carry as much alcohol as I can as it costs about at least 2x and sometimes 3x in my state.
In my earlier travel, I bought 2L of alcohol at Indian airport on landing, which is limit per passport.
My question is, whether I am allowed to buy alcohol where I am right now, and put it in checked in baggage?

I read online that I am allowed to carry about 5L in checked in baggage but few friends suggested here otherwise.
According to them I am allowed to carry 2L in baggage and 2L after getting to Indian airport (And 2 in flight if they come for sell, which I doubt since if I got 2 on flight will they allow me another 2 at Indian airport and will they let me board to next connecting flight)

I am not a regular traveler so there could be stupid questions and clauses which I assumed.

Flights,"[urgent] Weird situation with disappeared passport @ CLT (TSA post), advice much appreciated! Hi everyone, 

Posting just minutes after talking to a friend - his mom and dad were supposed to fly out of CLT internationally today. Long story short, they checked in, went through a primary TSA post (where boarding pass is checked against the passport), went to the x-ray station and were asked to put everything in a bin. They put both passports on top of the pile in one of the bins

**After the X-ray machine there was only ONE passport left in their bin!!!!**

The situation is still evolving now, apparently the supervisor was already called to this post and checked the inside of the x-ray machine and all areas around and his dad's passport is nowhere to be found like it vanished into the air. There's obviously no question he indeed had his passport at the post as he went through both check-in and the first TSA post, so it looks like it either:

- is somewhere deep in the x-ray machine

- was accidentally (or deliberately?!) taken by someone 

So far I suggested my friend to ask for CCTV footage asap and try to make an announcement on PA in the airport in case someone took the passport by accident. 

Any other thoughts and ideas? What should be immediate next steps? Police report? I'd suspect this should be a huge concern if something like this can happen literally a few feet from TSA officers and stay unnoticed...

Never thought such an issue can actually happen, so apologies if that's the wrong place for the thread! mods, feel free to move somewhere else if you feel it would be better suited there

Thanks a lot!

**UPD 9:00pm EST - Unbelievable! They found a passport jammed in an x-ray machine after a thorough inspection!!! Trying to arrange a flight now!**"

When going to their website, it would seem that an adult ticket is only for the ages 25-64. I'll be underneath this range at the time of travel, and unfortunately, the youth tickets are far more expensive, even with the maximum HOP discount.

Because there's nothing in their policies to suggest anything concrete, though I might have missed something, I am wondering whether I'd still be allowed to fly on an adult ticket, if I wanted to.

* direct flight from Recife to Angola. It's a little bit too southern from what I had in mind.

* direct flight from Recife to Capo Verde. I suspect there might be a ferry to Dakar from there, but haven't found out yet.

All other connections seem to go via Lisbon, Milan or south Africa which breaks  the purpose of the bike tour.

Any other Ideas? I'd also start from Sao Paulo or Rio if it's necessary."

Looking to do essentially the same trip starting end of June or early July and before even picking up a return date it's easily 600-700 dollars more.

Any idea what gives? Is June/July a more expensive time to fly to/from these places? Have flights gone up that much? I'm about the same number of weeks away from booking. Any insight would be good. Hopefully booking 2 tickets rather than 1 this time so an extra 1200-1400 more than I was expecting is tough to stomach. Cheers"

Potentially stupid question ... I am on the same booking with two of my friends, one of which has two baggages for check in (one 26kg, one 23kg).  Our booking has 20kg allowance so we will need to upgrade regardless.

At the end of June I am studying abroad in Germany, and I purchased a round-trip flight from Chicago last night for about $890. The first flight from Chicago to my layover in London is with Iberia (operated through American Airlines), and my flight from London to Frankfurt is with British Airways.

So my question is, if I wanted to check a bag, would it be sent through to Frankfurt or would I have to pick it up in London? My layover is only an hour and a half so I don't think I'd have the time for that. I read somewhere that Iberia and British Airways have some sort of partnership so maybe my baggage would be sent through, but since the flight is operated through American Airlines, would that make a difference?

There is a self transfer that I'm worried about in Kuwait, where I have just over 3 hours to switch airlines (FlyDubai to Pegasus). Unfortunately after doing some additional research I have found that Fly Dubai operates in a different terminal than everyone else and it is a 5 minute drive away to the other terminal, which is already a tight connection, and to make matters worse I now fear that I will have to get a visa on arrival after all which I'm not even sure they do at that particular terminal!

What is the real reason?

Also, this is really screwing us up due to work obligations both my wife and I won't be able to make on Tuesday. We will have lost wages, extra expenses in Rome, and in addition they are not providing transportation from JFK to EWR at this point and our car is parked in an off airport long term lot at EWR which of course will cost us more as we won't arrive until the following day.

What is our best course of action? FYI - we have already attempted to speak with ""Customer Relations"" and have been told they will not answer phone calls and will only respond emails sent through their website. They are asking for receipts of our expenses which of course we will provide but we are definitely seeking maximum compensation as this is a majorly screwing us over. Not to mention we paid premium for our flight from EWR to FCO and the lounge was closed with no explanations so they kind of screwed us on the way out as well.

Yesterday I was traveling from Manchester to Sofia with a layover in Frankfurt. When we landed in Frankfurt, due to the lengthy bus ride from the plane to the terminal (15-20 min), long walk to security (20 mins) and 30 minutes security queue, at which I was denied fast track check by a Frankfurt airport staff despite my flight being on the fast track notice board, I missed my flight to Sofia. All flights were operated by the same company and tickets were bought together as a trip from Manchester to Sofia. At the customer services desk of the airline I was told the earliest flight they could offer me a new ticket for was the following day but due to the company not being responsible for security checks they wont be paying me any compensation for the night I needed to spend at Frankfurt and I should contact airport staff to issue an official complaint. As staff were basically nonexistent that day at the airport or were mind numbingly stupid, incredibly rude or plainly unhelpful I was not able to issue a complaint with the airport or inquire about what my rights are in this situation. Now that I’ve finally arrived at my final destination my question is what are my rights as an EU citizen in this situation?

Flights,"Advanced Flight Search Tool/Website available? Hello,          
this one is difficult to explain so bear with me. :)        
Regular searches can result in either direct flights (more expensive) or some with stops in between (cheaper but longer).             
Sadly, both versions are only targeted at getting to your destination asap, while the later one tries to keep it cheap.            
Now, are there Tools/Websites that take ""longer"" timespans into account?      
Like saying you fly very cheap to a stop in between where you have to wait multiple days to catch a very cheap flight to fly to your final destination.             
The goal would be to catch the cheapest flights possible even if you have to wait multiple days in between, which would be fine as I could just stay at city X and see what's going on there. :)            
Sadly, no search tool I found so far includes this kind of thing. The only option would be to specify an airport in between but this doesn't include enough options to compare prices properly.             
You could say it's about Airport hopping which might be cheaper overall than direct flights or those with short stops in between.        
Greetings,

She'll already be elsewhere in Europe a few days before Greece, I'd need to fly in to meet her from the NYC area. Since we don't have to meet in Athens until a Sunday night, I thought I'd make the most of the weekend and maybe save some money by first flying into a different European city Friday night, spending Saturday in said city, then departing for Athens that Sunday morning/afternoon. So far the best deal I have found is for a $265 one way EWR-LHR flight with Virgin Atlantic through Skiplagged. (The flights out of JFK that same night are even cheaper, but I have family who could drive me to EWR) **It's a nonstop flight, no hidden city trickery. The thing is, I'm getting weirdly suspicious since I'm not seeing this fare anywhere else. Checked Kayak, Travelocity, Google Flights, Virgin's site, Momondo, ect. and the cheapest ticket for the same flight is $300+. The ones out of JFK are over $1,500 elsewhere.** I'm just super cautious as I've only ever booked one other international flight and it was direct both ways, round trip, pretty simple. Should I jump on the skiplagged price, or do you think there's a risk that it could get cancelled on me or something? Should I trust it? I don't think this is an error fare as I've re-run the search over the course of a few days, nearly a week, and it's been sitting at that price with one day of fluctuation in between. "

Something has come up and my girlfriend and I have to make it to Seattle next week. We have enough miles to purchase one ticket, and with a little research we've determined that it would be the most cost efficient to purchase miles directly through United. When heading to check out, this information is provided: https://imgur.com/kraFBZc

My question stems primarily from the 4th bullet point. It states that bonus miles will credited when the transaction is complete. So is this stating that I will not receive my purchased miles right away as I have anticipated? Also, do I receive the bonus miles when my card is charged as this is when the transaction is ""complete"", or will I receive these along with the miles I purchased??

If I need to wait for these miles to go into affect then it would be better for me to explore other more expensive options. /-:

Flights,"Airline lost my luggage - they’ll reimburse me for items I have receipts for but I can’t find many receipts. What are my options? The title pretty much sums it up.

I filled out an inventory a day or so after the flight. Even then a lot of the items were years old, so even though I had a clear memory of what I had, I had to estimate/guess the prices. It totalled up to £600. My friend who helped me complete the inventory told me to be generous with the pricing, apparently that’s the norm. So the realistic value is around the £450 mark. 

The airline told me that they’re going to reimburse me for my missing items but first they want any receipts I have. I can only find receipts for seven of the thirty plus items I had in my luggage. 

Today they told me that I’d be paid a lump sum of £193. Which is the total amount I’ve proved with my receipts plus the cost of the items I bought while I was away (the items and their receipts are packed in with the luggage that was lost). That leaves roughly £250 worth of items that they’re not reimbursing me for.

I think I’ll be able to find more proof of my purchases by searching through my bank statements. But I’m sure there’s going to be a significant lack because a lot of them were done in cash, which I’ve no longer got the receipts for. Or the items were given to me. 

Has anyone been through something similar? Or does anyone have any advice? I’d be rreeeeeeally grateful 

I’m thinking of sending them a spreadsheet with a revised inventory and detailed description of each item. I don’t know if that would help, though, because it still doesn’t prove the cost.

TLDR - Airline will refund if got receipts. Me: not got receipts. What do?

I'd like to apologize in advance if what i say is not clear, english isn't my first language.

I'll start with my passport : I'm french and in hold a ""biometric"" French passport.

I have a really specific question, by pure luck i very recently got back in touch a with a lost good friend. He dissapeared one day and i never heard back from him. He reconnected on a online game we played together and i asked him where did he go. He told me he needed a change of life and he had a opportunity in Korea so he took it. 
Back to the point, he is gonna get married in China (Haikou to be precise) this wesneday and invited me (out of the blue) to his marriage, he says he is paying for the travel, and i need a break, so i took his offer.

Problem is, i can't get a visa before this date, it is too late, i went to the agency that give visa in Paris (""visa for china"") and they said even with their express service, it would be too late for me (The first appointment available is just before the weeding so ...).

The lady at the desk told me i could always try to go to Haikou with a ""144h transit visa"". I looked into it, i need to do something like Paris -&gt; Shangai -&gt; Bruxelles if i want it to work.

The thing is, Shangai seems very far away from haikou, like 24h of train away. 
So my questions are : 

**1/Can i take a Shangai -&gt; Haikou flight while in there, with my transit visa, to get to Haikou ?**

I didn't manage to find any clear informations about flight while there, but my insticts tells me that it is most likely not possible.

So second solution :
2/Can i do something like Paris -&gt; Shangai -&gt; Macao or HK (i think they count as foreing country) and then get my way to haikou by flight / train / boat ?

Any helps or insight would be very appreciated guys, i'd really like to be able to attend at the party :(

Anyway, have a good day everyone! "

I'm looking for advice on how save money on flights on a multi-city tour of Asia. I'm taking a break from work to travel to Asia for around 2 months. From early April to mid June. I can be pretty flexible on dates and times, except for the following:

4/9 - 4/30 +/- a day or two in Seoul (visiting a friend)
5/1 - 5/13 +/- a day or two in Guangzhou (visiting family)

The journey will start in Seoul around April 8-9, as I'm meeting a friend there, and will end with Japan as my last leg (bringing fresh snacks) around June 26.

These the other places I want to visit, in order of importance:
- Taipei
- Singapore
- Thailand
- Vietnam
- Philippines

I'm not a very frequent traveler, hence why I want to do such a long vacation since I have some time, so I don't know how to find the best deals on flights. The way I'm approaching it is flying in a straight (circular) path rather than back and forth between cities. 

If I were to go to all those places, it would be something like this:
SFO &gt; Seoul &gt; Guangzhou &gt; Vietnam &gt; Thailand &gt; Singapore &gt; Philippines &gt; Taipei &gt; Japan &gt; SFO. 

Then I'm searching on google flights for one way trips from each of those cities to the next to get a baseline of which are the cheapest dates to fly. Then at the end, do a multi-city search and book the flights via google flights? Is this a reasonable approach to save money on flights?

Tentative schedule

* SFO - ICN 4/9

* ICN - CAN 4/30

Looking for advice on a flight from Cleveland or Pittsburgh to London with a stopover in Reykjavik for the first week of June. I have vacation from work June 1-11 so my dates are rather fixed. I will be traveling alone.

So far my options seem to be 
Iceland Air: Cleveland 1st -&gt; London 7th -&gt; Reykjavik 10th -&gt; Cleveland for ~ $1080
or WOW air with a similar itenerary from either Pittsburgh or Cleveland for about $760 after adding a carry on bag for every leg. I've also looked at doing my stopover in Iceland on the way out instead and the prices don't seem to change much.

My questions are that the Iceland Air flights from Cleveland are new beginning in May, so is there any opportunity for the price to drop? Or will it only go up?

If I were to fly WOW, I'd consider trying to pack entirely in a backpack to make that fare even cheaper, but I'm not against paying for the bag. I realize they're a discount airline and I'd be getting discount service, but I've read both horror stories and ""meh, it was fine"" stories both here on Reddit and elsewhere.

Will they question where the other passenger is and charge the $275 for her not showing up?

TLDR: two passengers flying, one has to leave early, will me showing up alone raise any eyebrows?"
Flights,"Flying to Japan, Questions about Kayak's Hacker Fares I'm going on a trip to Japan as part of a study abroad group during May, departing from Nashville (BNA) on the 14th and landing in Narita (NRT) the afternoon of the 15th.

Currently I'm looking at a round trip flight that goes BNA -&gt; LAX -&gt; NRT, with a 3 hour layover in LAX. Normally, this wouldn't be any concern, but the trip is listed through Kayak's hacker fares, so its actually two tickets (one round trip BNA/LAX through Delta, another LAX/NRT through United). 

I've done some research, but I'm still not entirely sure how this will affect my trip and would appreciate if someone could help clarify a few main points. Primarily:

1. How will this affect my baggage? (ie. will I need to go to baggage claim in LAX and recheck everything in since it will be with different airlines, or can I still have it follow me straight from BNA?)
2. If my BNA -&gt; LAX flight is delayed/canceled (or NRT -&gt; LAX on the return) and I am not able to reach the next flight in time, will the airline(s) still work with me to get me on another flight?
3. Depending on the answers to the previous questions, will a 3 hour layover in LAX be too tight/risky? I don't fly often and I'm not familiar with LAX so I'm hoping someone with some more experience could give some advice.

Thanks!"

Flights,"Cancellation Vs. Change? Hey all. I recently bought a RT ticket through United from Philly to Salt Lake City. About a week later me and my friend decided we would stay longer, drive south and check out the Grand Canyon and eventually fly out of Phoenix.
We leave March 31st and return on April 7th.

Yesterday I called United to see about changing my departure location and was informed there is a $200 cancelation fee + the cost of the new flight from Phoenix to Philly. 

So I booked the new one way flight from Phoenix, and skipped the fee.

Currently the 2 flights that I had originally booked on my return trip are selling for $157 and $357. Would it not be beneficial for the airline to know that I won't be on the plane so that they can rebook these seats? 
Is there any way I can talk them into giving a credit/miles? 

I always look at that ""buy insurance"" and say ahhhh I don't need that. Lesson learned.

TIA for any input.

There is still some suggestion of purchasing checked bags at the gate but I am not sure if that means the bags after those that are included.

Flights,"Question on changing/cancelling LATAM partially used ticket I recently bought a business class RT fare through LATAM, going from BOG-SCL-PUQ, since it was cheaper than one way. 

The fare structure was like this:

**Outbound (already flown):**

BOG-SCL LA575 (booking class: D)

SCL-PUQ LA97 (booking class: Y)

**Return:**

PUQ-SCL LA284 (booking class: Y)

SCL-BOG LA572 (booking class: I)


I've been doing some digging, but am still a bit confused about changes possible for partially-used tickets, especially with mixed bucket fares. I've already flown the outbound (BOG-SCL-PUQ), but I was wondering if I could do any of the following:

1. Change the destinations/routing of the return segments (PUQ-SCL-BOG to something like SCL-IPC or SCL-GYE, or double open-jaw so I can fly out of Argentina?)

2. Cancel the PUQ-SCL leg, but maintain the SCL-BOG leg

3. Get a partial refund? (Although it says that the final leg SCL-BOG is non-refundable, so I doubt it)


The only option I am seeing on the website is changing the date of the return segments for a fee (I'm willing to foot the bill), but none to cancel one leg or changing the destinations.

I'd appreciate any input you may have, thanks!

Flights,"Flying from Los Angeles to Rome But I have a question about night flights and what makes more sense. So the time difference is 9 hours (if it's 1 pm in LA then it's 10 pm in Rome) and the cheapest flight I have seen leaves at 1 pm-ish, but because of the 12 hour flight and the time difference, it would be about 10:45 am when I arrive. Is this going to mess me up and essentially be a waste of a day (will I be too tired when I arrive even though it will be like 11 am and just end up sleeping half the day?) or should I look for a later departure time so that when I arrive it will be later in the day and it will be more balanced (even though it will be a day ahead anyway)?

Yesterday I was supposed to fly from Florence -&gt; Paris -&gt; Newcastle, leaving Florence at 12:00 and leaving Paris at 15:00, finally arriving in Newcastle at 15:50. However, due to an operational fault (no specifics were given), the Air France flight from Paris to Florence was cancelled the day before. 

Eventually, Air France scheduled me on a Florence -&gt; Amsterdam -&gt; Newcastle flight, which left Florence at 12:50 and eventually, after a 7 hour layover in Amsterdam, arrived in Newcastle at 22:00. This is way beyond the 3 hours supported by EU regulations, so I was wondering whether I could claim compensation. 

The issue is both the Air France website and some other websites (e.g. [which?](https://www.which.co.uk/consumer-rights/advice/i-had-a-flight-cancellation-can-i-claim-compensation)) say that I need to have checked into the flight before I am protected. I had checked into the first flight, the one that wasn't cancelled, but not the second. Obviously, after the flight was cancelled I was no longer allowed to check in.

Other websites such as [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/) make no mention of this checking in detail. Therefore, I was wondering if someone more experienced could give me advice on this as this is the first time I've needed to file a claim.

I'm flying to Peru this summer and would like to visit Ecuador as well. As of now I know that I will have the budget for 5 weeks, but I'm anticipating a raise and may have enough for several more weeks, especially if I decide to do a Workaway or something else to save money while there. I don't want to get stuck in the country buying a last minute and possibly very expensive one way flight home, but I also would like the option to stay as long as my money lasts/I'm not horribly homesick. 


I was thinking book with Copa, round trip for the 5 weeks I know I'll be there, then pay a change fee if I decide to stay longer, but I'm having a really hard time finding information on their change fees, or if they even allow it. The way I'm understanding their website is it costs $25 and up, and you can change to a different date as long as it's the same day of the week and route. I have a few questions about this.

1) Is this how you also understand it or have experience with it? I'm a little confused and this will be my first trip I've organized myself, so I don't want to take the risk of having misunderstood and potentially not be able to change at all.

2) If the change fee is $25 or up, doesn't that mean it could be some ridiculously high amount and there's no way for me to know since they don't show any range? I read a review online about them charging a high change fee, but it was only one and I'm well aware that people tend to post more often with a single bad experience even if there are many great experiences.

3) Do you have any experience flying with Copa/ changing the date of a return flight? If so, what was your experience like and what tips do you have?

Looking for a one way flight from La Paz, Bolivia LPB to Vancouver, Canada YVR at somepoint in March (although if possible, I would like to arrive by March 20). Looking for economy flight. 

This is what I found so far:


Avianca
Total Duration: 21h 30m
2 Stops via Bogota, Colombia and Mexico City or Cancun, then to Vancouver with WestJet (the final leg). About $750 one-way. The price for this one is standard, I am assuming, I like it because the flight duration between each stop is relatively short, about 4-5 hours.

Air Canada $688 this is a Long layover, Overnight flight with 2 stops via 	
Lima (LIM) OPERATED BY LATAM AIRLINES PERU Layover in LIM
18h 25m then to Toronto and then to Vancouver by Air Canada.

Or maybe the best one: 

AVIANCA to Lima Layover	01h05m
then to Cancun Layover	02h33m
then to YVR with WestJet
But it is $1000 in price. I'm leaning toward this one

Perhaps the best option is to fly to Cancun with Avianca and then change to Westjet or AirtTransat for the rest of the trip to Vancouver, adding up to about $700-800 one way.

If you know of another connection, please let me know"

I called vayama and they said they can’t change it. I called Finnair, and Finnair said vayama can change it, and the rep from Finnair asked to do a three way call to add a vayama rep on the line. All of a sudden, Vayama could change the name, and sent the issue over to their NAME CHANGE DEPARTMENT. They asked us to send our passport information, which we did, and they said they’d change it.

 

A few weeks later, I haven’t heard anything from vayama, so I call and they said they’re working on it, and we’ll hear back by next week.

 

A few weeks after that, I called again and they said they’re still working on it. A few more weeks, and I call and they said they’re waiting on authorization from Finnair, we’ll hear back in a week or so.

 

After calling them back and them saying they’re still working on it (“you’ll hear from us within 48 hours”) I called Finnair. I explained the situation, and they were surprised Finnair said it was up to them because they haven’t heard from Vayama and even if they did, it’s completely up to Vayama, they don’t need to approve anything. Called Vayama again, and they said its not up to Finnair, it’s up to the consolidator of the ticket, American. I called American and talked to them about it and they said no, it’s up to vayama, they don’t control anything with the ticket.

 

I called Vayama AGAIN and they said the person I talked to at American AND Finnair were both wrong, and that they need approval from Finnair, American, and the other airline that has a leg of this flight (British air I think?) and they said if I can get it in writing form these airlines that they have no control over the ticket, they’ll “take a look at it again.”

 

I’m ready to contact every airline involved to get it in writing but I feel like I am being given the run-around here by Vayama to exhaust me until I don’t care anymore (Joke is on them, this is for my honeymoon so I won’t stop until this is changed.)

 

The kicker is their BBB profile has multiple complaints by others who experienced the same issue: two people book a flight, and one name is on both tickets.

 

Can anyone explain what is going on here? Is there anything else I can do? I want to get the flight details nailed down before I book hotels, and fortunately the flight is 3 months away.



TL;DR Vayama says they’re waiting on other airlines for authorization to fix the name on the ticket, but keep changing their story on me and are not doing anything. I don’t know what to do. 

Thank you in advance! "

Flights,Am I better off spending $260 for a round trip from Oslo to London(total two tickets) on Norwegian Air than sticking with the $150 I’ve already spent on tickets with Ryanair? I’m heading to Oslo on March 12 and will also be traveling to  London and have already spent $150 on  tickets for me and my girlfriend. I’ve been looking at check in and baggage and carry on and it looks like I’ll be spending more possibly even another $150. People have told me that they heard Ryanair is terrible and some have said they were fine. But I’m curious if I should still stick with Ryanair for this trip or will I be better off just going with Norwegian air and taking the bullet on the money I spent already on Ryanair? Is Ryanair as bad as people say it is? I have two separate flights( ended up deciding to stay a few more days in London than my return flight therefore have two separate Ryanair flights).

Flights,"How good is Air India as an airline? How bad - or good - of an experience should I expect? (SFO - DEL - BOM and back) Hey guys,

I was just wondering how Air India is as an airline. This summer, after I graduate high school, I will be going to India by myself to visit my grandparents in Mumbai, India. I graduate on June 6, and have an Air India flight AI 174 from San Francisco to New Delhi on June 9, and a connection to Mumbai on AI 24. I will return to San Francisco on June 23 with AI 101 and AI 173 respectively.

I've seen some pretty bad reviews for Air India online, as such:

https://youtu.be/ZcqH1W_vI_o (Hilarious video, I recommend you guys watch)

https://youtu.be/90XzxtHjr3g

There are other negative reports and videos, too. There are some positive reviews (such as on Mark Wiens' YouTube channel and a few reports on other websites), but at least based off of my research, the negative reviews outweigh the positives. The 2 hour flight from Delhi to Mumbai will certainly be manageable, but I'll be spending 16-17 hours to and from Delhi and San Francisco. 

** I am by no means scared or worried about the flight. I'm ready to man it up - especially for the 16 hour flight to and from Delhi - but I just wanted to know how much of a bad - or perhaps even good - experience I should be hoping / preparing for. **

My aunt and uncle have also flown this airline when coming to visit us in California, and I haven't heard too much crap about the airline from them (except maybe having annoying passengers sitting next to them), but I don't know if they were just being calm and positive to keep us from worrying about them. 

The reason my parents and I chose Air India was because of cost. Since my dad flies a lot, he had a ton of United Miles which he used to book my flight - that way, we could save money. The Air India flight was only 40,000 miles, but the next airline on the list - Lufthansa - costed 95,000 miles - almost twice as much. There was also an Air Canada flight for a similar amount of miles, but that would have 2 layovers, which we didn't see justifiable, as it is going to be my first time flying alone. That is why we chose Air India. We booked the flight today because summer is the peak time for flying - especially in America - and we wanted to book before the prices became exorbitantly high. 

I would appreciate your feedback and thoughts!

Also, let me know if there is an Air India or other travel subreddit which I should repost this on to get more answers. "

Flights,"Skiplagged worth the risk for my situation? I'm a student studying abroad in London.  On the weekends I've been traveling to other countries around Europe, but I'm trying to save as much money as possible since it's such an expensive semester.  Our spring break is coming up and we're visiting Paris, then Nice, then Lisbon.

Unfortunately flights from Nice to Lisbon are incredibly expensive on the day we have to fly (about $160).  However, there's a Skiplagged flight via Tap Portugal Airlines from Nice to Madrid with a connection in Lisbon that's much much cheaper at about half the price (around $80).  Also, the layover is 10 hours long, so it's not like the airline is going to force passengers to stay on the plane.

I know the widely-known risks of doing this, but as I'm a study abroad student in London, the following shouldn't affect me:

- It'll be a one-way ticket, since after Lisbon we're going to London and not back to Nice, so there's no concern about the airline cancelling our trip home.  Also our flight back to London is on a different airline.

- Because we're only in Lisbon for a few days, none of us are checking our baggage - we're each bringing carry-ons.  And most of our bags are backpacks and therefore should fit under our seats.

- None of us are on any sort of frequent flyer programs, so there's no risk of being kicked out of the airline's program

- Since we're from the US, we'll each have our passports with us

However, I was wondering the following:

1. Can the airline do anything to us like fine us?

2. What are the odds they don't let us bring on our carry-ons?  Does getting to the airport earlier to ensure getting on the plane first solve this issue?

3.  Do we need anything more than our passports for the flight to Madrid even though we're getting off at Lisbon?

4.  How often do airlines change the layover location due to delays or weather?  If this happens, what do I do?

Please answer these questions if you can, or let me know if you know of any other possible consequences.

And above all, given what I've described, do you think it's worth it?  Thanks."

Today we were flying AirAsia flight (FD3224) from Krabi to Bangkok. During take off we were flying through some heavy clouds, although the weather was good. I had a feeling that we were not climbing straight up rather we were very slow changing the altitude while pilot was manoeuvring during the climb. At some point, I would say very low in the sky (maybe about 1000-2000 feets), we felt very sudden drop of about 5-10s, plane was flying down very steep. Fortunately, the pilot leveled plane after 10s, but the experience was terrible. Any idea why this happened? "

Flights,"Plane ticket had the wrong name, company refuses to reimburse. I had a plane ticket from Oporto, Portugal to NY, USA on Friday (02/09/2018). I got to the check-in area and was surprised when the lady at the desk told me my ticket had the wrong name. My surname was duplicated for some reason.
I did the booking online and when I checked the reservation my name was duplicated for some reason (could be the system, but probably my fault or some auto-fill suggestion).
In the rush of not missing my flight I was advised by the person behind the desk to buy a new ticket and ask for a refund. This was a 460€ ticket so, not the cheapest of mistakes.

I tried to get a refund but the person at customer service just said that due to my ticket not being insured, I would not be able to get a full refund. Just the 60€ of airport taxes.

So bottom line. I bought the ticket, had to cancel due to a mistake that no one can be sure where it happened, bought another ticket so the company still got their money (no damage done to them whatsoever), was advised by someone behind their desk that I'd have a refund. Shouldn't this be a simple moral/ethic behaviour on their part to just give the full refund and not make me go through all this? I'm filling an official complaint to them but fear the answer will be the same. What else can I do?

I am in England at the moment and flying back to the states on may 16 th with British airways, and want to extend my flight by another 2-3 weeks. there is a 200 dollar charge for doing this on top of the flight difference , so it looked like I could only find flights for around 400 dollars at the least.

 In my opinion, it wouldn't be worth it to spend nearly have a grand just to stay a few more weeks when I got this 4 month return ticket for 700 something dollars.

  I found out by doing a brief search on google flights that I could  find a one way flight for around 200 pounds. This would be much cheaper, as I did a refund calculation with British airways if I canceled my ticket - I would get around 160 dollars if I cancelled, so I would just be spending the difference with the ticket and the refund. It seems the cheap flights I found on google made stops and seemed to be 11 hour flights instead of the usual 8, as these were Icelandic and Portuguese airlines. 

So my short question is - is what google flights is showing me likely to be the best I'm going to get?

The issue I'm faced with now is that I've booked a one-way ticket and one requirement of the temporary visa is return flight information.  I'm wondering if the best course of action would be to purchase a one way return ticket with some type of insurance and then cancel it once I've arrived and have my long term visa.  Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!!
Flights,"First time international traveler, I have a few questions about connecting in Europe. I have planned my honeymoon for end of May/early June. We are flying from Chicago to Copenhagen, and then Copenhagen to Greece. On the way there we will only be in Copenhagen to switch planes, but on the way back we will be spending a few days there. I booked A-B and B-C as separate round trips on different carriers. We land in Copenhagen at 12:40pm, and our flight to Athens is 2:55pm. A few questions about this: 

1.  I know we will have to get our bags and check in again for our new flight. I assume we have to go through customs at this point. How long does customs typically take? 

2.  What can I do if anything to speed up the time it takes to go through customs, get our bags checked and get on our next flight?

3.  If our flight to Copenhagen is delayed I am almost certain we will miss our flight to Athens. Is there any travel insurance we can get to protect against this? I've only see insurance that requires the delay to be at least 3 hours, and I am a dumby and now realize even a one hour delay and we're fucked. 

I am flying Finnair from Chicago to Copenhagen and Lufthansa from Copenhagen to Athens. If I have made this connecting time unreasonably short, what do I need to do to fix this? 


Thank you for your help in advance!"

Flights,"Ticket Pending on American Airlines Have a May flight booked on American and they've already modified the schedule twice. First time I called in and was able to change flights and get a new ticket issued but this last time I called in and the ticket is still pending. I initially called on Saturday and changed the connecting flight to a better time (originally booked that time but got bumped when they changed the aircraft and flight number). Checked yesterday and it's still pending although my account shows the correct flight and seats but I called in again Monday morning. Agent thought it was because the final flight had changed as well so she set that one up. Today it still shows ticket pending and no confirmation email so far. Any ideas? It's an international flight connecting through ORD.

Update: called back in today because it was still pending. Agent told me the final leg (last schedule change) was still an issue and she ""cleaned it up"" got my confirmation about 30 minutes later. Seems like the previous agent didn't get everything in correctly something."

Flights,"My lastnames were merged/put together on my flight reservation I'm flying to Argentina with LATAM Brazil but first i'm flying out of Venezuela through Brazil with AVIOR.

I had only purchased a one-way ticket to Brazil through Avior since i don't plan on coming back soon, but the airline told me that boarding with just a one-way ticket would be a problem and that i might even be denied boarding if i didn't have a return ticket.

I went ahead and booked a return ticket on Expedia.com and while my flight is booked normally, my two last names appear ""merged"" on my reservation.

Let's say my name is ""Juan Johnson Smith"" with Johnson and Smith being my last names. In my reservation i appear as ""Juan Johnsonsmith"".

I called Expedia support and they told me this shouldn't be a problem but i want to be extra sure that this won't represent a problem when i board the plane to Brazil (in case they ask for a return ticket). I don't plan on using the return ticket anyways.

I'll be really busy for the next couples of days so i can't go to Avior's offices and ask them myself and they won't answer the phone number they provided me with, so i figured i'd ask here in case anyone has experience with this.

Flights,"Recently had to change names on a few flights, looking for reassurance A friend and I are going to Europe soon, the tickets were purchased through travelocity who then bought them from united airlines. When buying the tickets on travelocity they asked if my friend an I had any titles we wanted used, so of course we chose esquire and PhD because we thought it would look cool. The flights are actually operated by Lufthansa, Swiss international airlines and Swiss global airlines even though they were purchased through united, and will go from Chicago to Munich and then Munich to Budapest on Lufthansa, then later from Bucharest to Zurich on Swiss international, and then finally from Zurich back to Chicago on Swiss global. So today I attempted to check my booking, and Lufthansa wouldn't let me through with my last name and confirmation number, but I tried using my last name plus the letters ""esq"" and that worked. It was at this point I realized I'm totally fucked if I show up to the airport in Chicago and go to the Lufthansa ticket counter with my passport and try to get my tickets with my last name having an extra ""esq"" on it, so I called Lufthansa. A nice German man told me that I would indeed be fucked if I showed up to the airport and tried to claim the tickets as they were, but that he can't take the ""esq"" off for me because travelocity are actually the people who bought the tickets. So then I called travelocity and they claimed to have no record of me ever buying any tickets from them, seemed a little fishy but I figured whatever I'll just try United. So I finally get put through to a pleasant homosexual Hispanic man with United and explain my whole situation to him, he told me he couldn't just change the names on the tickets because that would void some of the flights, but that he could put some sort of note with mine and my friends ticket information saying that our last names don't actually have ""esq"" and ""PhD"" at the end of them. The guy from united also told me that Lufthansa won't have this info in their system, it'll just show up for them at the ticket counter in Chicago when I go to get my tickets, and he said I ""just have to trust [him] on this one."" What do you guys think? Can I leave it as it now is and call it good? Or do I need to take further steps to insure I'm not just another statistic in the long line of people who have been royally fucked by airlines? Any help is appreciated."

Flights,"Interjet vs. Volaris for Trip to Mexico I am planning a trip from Guatemala City (GUA) to Leon (BJX) for late March. Interjet and Volaris are my two reasonably priced options - have never flown either. There is also AeroMexico on this route, but because of their restrictions on sports equipment, it's not an option for me.

Cost is roughly about the same between these two airlines. The Volaris flight is quicker but requires an overnight stop in Tijuana for 4 hours. The Interjet flight goes through Mexico City but I'll be stuck there during the day for 10.5 hours. 

Which airline/flight/connecting airport seems better? In addition to this, should I factor any security concerns with two checked bags (one with bicycle) being at the airport overnight or for a long length of time? Will I need to pick up the bags when arriving in Mexico, go through customs, and re-check them in - or are they checked all the way through to Leon?

UPDATE: I decided to try Volaris. While looking at online booking at both airlines' sites, I noticed Volaris had a combo option under extras that included a sports bag. Along with a promotion this weekend, it brought the cost down substantially. And with the shorter overall trip time (albeit in the middle of the night) and a bit more flexibility with baggage, it was enough to commit me to try Volaris over Interjet. From online research though, I did see that Interjet had slightly better reviews/service overall compared to Volaris."

 Originally the plan was for me to go up to my buddys place and we would then get a flight from Manchester. 

My buddy was looking at flights today and the specific flight he's looking at has a single changeover at Heathrow. This gives me a different option. Rather than travel up to my buddy, stay overnight, then travel to Manchester and get a flight to LHR for a changeover, I could travel from mine to LHR as it's about 1 hour 30 minute drive from where I live.

This sounds great for me as it involves much less travelling on my part. However, the flight from Manchester to Washington with the stopover is £363. The direct flight from LHR to Washington is £611. I don't really want to spend an extra £150 for that, so my question is this; if I purchase the tickets for the Manchester route, can I skip that leg of the journey and go straight to LHR from my place, or am I required to go from Manchester?

I get an email a couple weeks ago (like 5 months after booking the flight and less than a month before the trip) that the itinerary has changed and my return flight now has a third leg, adding Denver to Newark and then Newark to Dulles, arriving at 7:35am now.

After speaking with United, the best alternative flight (even from San Fran) puts us in that morning at 6:59am. This means we will both be a couple hours late for work rather than on time, especially due to the traffic on the drive home that will shoot up by then.

What am I entitled to for compensation? The US DOT regulation says I'm entitled to 400% of the original one-way flight cost if the change results in arrival more than 2 hours after the original arrival time. However, that refers to overbooking. Does this apply? If not, what are my options? Missing a few hours of work costs me money in terms of vacation time, so there is a legitimate cost on my end."

I know there are worst things but I'm slightly claustrophobic and on an 10+ hours flight I'm always careful to get an aisle seat. I silently cried during one hour and they didn't care. Not a good trip!    

I wonder if it was mere incompetence or if they did it on purpose to optimize the seats plan. What do you think?

Flights,"United Airlines (MileagePlus Member) - Basic Economy Woes I'm wanting to fly out of FWA and I enjoy the priority boarding &amp; free checked bag that the MileagePlus card gives me. My problem is that it seems all the American airline companies have switched to this shitbag ""Basic Economy"" class thing where there's no free checked bag and/or there's no ability to choose your seat. My wife flies with me and wants to sit next to me as she is afraid of flying.

Am I missing something? Is there somewhere else I should be looking? I do CheapOAir usually, but have used the SkyScanner website.

Every site now seems to quote this shitty ""Basic Economy"" service. Is this what the future of flying is?"

Flights,"First time flying internationally (MCI-SLP) I need help. I’m flying to San Luis Potosí, Mexico Feb 15th 
I magically found inexpensive tickets on aeromexico’s website. 

The con that came with that price is that it has two layovers 

Delta 
MCI 2:02pm-&gt; ATL 5:10pm 

Delta
ATL 6:09-&gt; MTY(MX) 8:30pm

Aeromexico 
MTY 10:07-&gt;SLP 11:07pm

 (I have no idea if the landing is my time or Atlanta time. Time zone changes confuse me significantly. Even if it’s just an hour difference.)

I have tried to google maps to see the layout of the airports so I’m half confident. 

Also, would I go through immigration, customs whatever it’s called at MCI or would I have to do it at the Atlanta airport? Or both? 
I only have an hour and I’m afraid I won’t have enough time. 
Oh! I’m also not checking in luggage. I’ll have a carry on and a personal item.  Just to make the process easier since I’ve read that sometimes when you have different airlines you have to re check in the suitcase.

I’ve always been fairly paranoid when it comes to flying. 
Honestly, for anything which is why I leave to the airport extremely early even though I know I could probably check in within an hour or less. 

Should I have concerns for my returning flights? 

Aeromexico 
SLP 6:30am-&gt; MTY 7:29am

Delta 
MTY 8:30am -&gt; ATL 12:15pm

Delta 
ATL 2:58pm -&gt; MCI 4:15pm

I appreciate all the help! Sorry if my question sound a little confusing or dumb. I plan on calling the airline just to have a piece of mind. I just wanted to avoid that if reddit could help. 😅😁

If by any chance I have an hour free at the Atlanta airport and the Monterrey airport

+As well, when buying my return flight ticket should I use another site? Google's one way ticket thru American Airlines is around $500 while their site charges about $700.

I was looking at departing on a Friday to go there and departing the next Saturday to come back home.

All the tickets I'm finding are so expensive, like $1500. But, I also keep seeing that if I fly into London instead of Manchester the cost goes down a ton, some dates I was looking at were down to under $900, but then that would involve a train or bus or something.

So, my question is can I have some help finding a flight into Manchester for that same price ~$900, or are there packages with plane and train tickets and whatnot to make things easier if I have to fly into London?

Flights,"Finding comfortable (economy+/business) flights FRA/LHR/CPH to LAS/DIA/SEA with very open requirements If you have the below very broad requirements, how do you go about finding the best deal, so we can travel to the US in comfort?

**When:** April-June, for 8-10 days - very flexible on that

**From:** Copenhagen, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Oslo, Stockholm

**To:** Seattle, Las Vedas, Denver - or in that triangle

**Class:** At least economy+, but preferably something where you can lie down and sleep, if it is financially feasible

**Budget:** 1300EUR/person

##A bit of background

I would like to treat my 65yo father to a trip in the western US (Seattle/Denver/Las Vegas - see Grand Canyon, Bryce, Yosemite).

We live in Europe (Denmark for him, Malta for me). We would have to fly to an airport in Europe to meet up and then fly together to US - but that short trip is outside the scope of my question. :)

My father is in OK health, but he is 188cm (6ft1) and a gentleman of a certain girth - and I am 194cm (6ft4) and no stick myself. Being cramped up in economy class seats for 10+ hours is just a non-starter.

So since we have extremely flexible requirements, I thought there must be a way to find some fairly priced tickets. I could just start trying all kinds of combinations, change dates etc, but... There must be a better way. How would one go about doing that? 

##Questions
Any tips on which routes and airlines are more likely to meet my requirements?

Is it realistic to get seats where you can lie down in this price range?

Flights,"Advice on missed Ryanair flight I am hoping people on this sub-reddit might be able to give me some advice. Myself and my GF were due to fly from Brussels airport to Dublin airport with Ryanair in mid December. When we got to the airport there were multiple flights being cancelled due to snowy weather conditions. Nonetheless, our flight was still scheduled to go ahead. 

We went up to the Ryanair check in desk to check our bags in. After about 30 minutes of no progress in the line, I went up to ask the Ryanair staff member if the flight was still going ahead. She informed me that all Ryanair flights for that day were cancelled and she handed me a Ryanair reimbursement form for delayed/cancelled flights. I was following Ryanair, Brussels airport and other people scheduled to take the flight we were on Twitter, and there was no clear answer as to whether the flight was going ahead. 

In a bit of a panic as we had to get back home as soon as possible, we booked flights (over 300 euro for 2 people) for the next day with a separate airline company (Ryanair's flights for the subsequent few days were all booked out) to get back to Dublin. We then returned to Brussels and booked ourselves into a hotel. However, later that night we found out that the flight we were meant to take did actually go ahead, albeit with some delay. Myself and my GF were pretty annoyed as we missed our flight due to a Ryanair member of staff telling me it was cancelled and not delayed. In retrospect, we probably should have waited at the airport until it was scheduled to leave to make sure. But we took this staff member's word as we assumed that this person would be the most informed about Ryanair flights.

Since then, I have been in contact with Ryanair through social media, direct chat on their website and through various emails. They haven't been very helpful or open to much dialogue but in short, they said that as the flight did indeed go ahead, we are not entitled to any compensation from them. 

I'm just wondering if anyone on this sub-reddit has any advice on what I should do next or if there is anything I can do?

Many thanks!"

Flights,"United Agent lied to me in order to bump me from flight. Potential recourse? Last night United needed to bump someone from my regional turboprop flight due to weight imbalance issues. Instead of offering incentives, the agent lied to me to prevent me from boarding. She told me my flight was delayed by one hour, that I would surely miss my connection and spend the night at Dulles airport, and that I needed to change flights. It turns out that was completely false--the flight was never delayed, it took off early and arrived ahead of schedule. It seems she just lied to me to avoid having to go through the incentive process.

This was a pre-security agent I spoke with when I tried to check my bag. I told her I had already checked in online and that if the bag was the issue, she could send my bag on a later flight. But she persisted with her story that the flight was delayed by an hour and I would miss my connection anyway and there were no alternate flights in the morning from that airport.

I filed a complaint on United's website. Any thoughts on what to expect from here or advice for potential recourse? I was put on a flight a day later and am missing my first day of University classes as a result, not to mention the inconvenience and having to drive to the airport (over an hour away) twice.

Edit to clarify:  
When I checked in online, I was prompted with a message that someone may need to be removed from my flight and I was asked how much I would be willing to accept in vouchers to give up my seat (I responded that I was not willing). 

When I attempted to check my bag, I was told by the agent that:  
1. I could not get my checked bag on the flight because it was ""restricted"" for weight balance issues. And,  
2. Even if I were to get on the flight, with or without my bag, the flight was delayed by an hour and I would surely miss my connection so it was irrelevant.  

I asked twice if I could simply send my checked bag on a later flight and board this one, as I needed to get to my destination for class in the morning. But she repeated that the reason I could not do this is because the flight was delayed and I would miss my connection anyways.

We had booked this return journey (IAH-SJO) through Expedia and received Lufthansa flight numbers to be operated by United and both Lufthansa and United booking codes. I went ahead and added my Lufthansa miles and more account to the booking to make sure I get the miles for the booking. 
We fly to Costa Rica - everything normal (dreary 7 hour transfer in IAH). The return leg starts of the same and we spend 10 hours in IAH (went to the Zoo was actually awesome!) then when waiting to board the long return flight our names (with others) were called and we were upgraded!


Now the seats we had been assigned originally were Premium Economy according to Seat Guru but we paid the cheapest possible price. We had a V-class booking. 


I have no status with LH but desperately collect miles. My partner works for LH but I doubt that this played a role as I don't think United could possibly know that we works for LH.

Does anyone know why my partner and I were selected over other fliers? It is simply because I had a Miles and More membership on our booking?

I'm taking a domestic Delta flight early Thursday morning from MSY to JFK. I have about ~11 hours to kill before the flight on Norwegian Air to LGW. I went for a long layover in case there were issues/delays with Delta, but I didn't expect the chaos that JFK apparently is right now.

I was going to check a duffel, leave the terminal, pick it up, and come back inside and check it again with Norwegian. I'm studying abroad for 6 months and having that third bag with me would make packing MUCH better.

I'm under the impression that Terminal 4 is a shit show right now, but I'm not sure about the rest. I read that domestic Delta flights are in Terminal 2 and Norwegian operates out of 1. What are the odds my luggage gets stranded in NYC? If anyone has a take on this, I'd appreciate it."
Flights,"Luggage Didn't Make It To Final Destination - Air China Hello All - I read through the FAQ and didn't see anything related to a lost luggage situation so hoping this is OK to post here!

I am looking to see if anyone has any thoughts/advice on how to get ahead of the situation I am in. I had the following flights earlier this weekend:

HND -&gt; PEK -&gt; EWR

The layover in PEK was only 1.5 hrs and we landed an hour late so we barely made it to the second flight - the crew helped us cut all lines and rushed us to the other gate. I knew that since we barely made it ourselves, our checked bags likely wouldn't. When we were scanned into the second flight, I quickly asked the attendant who said yes but I knew it was likely just a blanket response. Got to EWR and the ~7 of us who had the same flight pattern all didn't get our bags. We got to the Air China cargo desk and a gentleman seemed very helpful and had us full out a quick report (PIR Property Irregularity Report) with my contact information, flight information, etc. He said they have a global tracking system and would call me in a few hours with the update. As you can imagine, this was Saturday early PM and now on Sunday night, we have not heard anything (I am friends with one of the others in this group). I called Air China but they said only the airport could help, which I've called numerous times to no avail (the # was on the report). I know Air China is known for subpar customer service (though my experience up to that point had been fine) and that the airline has had a mess at JFK over the weekend so I am worried our luggage will just get lost in the fray. I have no way of knowing if it was put on the next day flight to EWR from PEK, perhaps got sent on a JFK flight since that is also local for me or something in between. I feel in the dark and looking for any suggestions. I did find this link on the Air China website but I don't have actual File Reference to input: [WorldTracer](https://wtrweb.worldtracer.aero/WTRInternet/wtwflowinternet.do?_flowExecutionKey=_c7CB987B3-0EDD-3540-2B57-F96E08149ABE_k0FB912FC-C69A-239A-A96D-2258DEE96E64)

Flights,"Forgot an iPad filled with wedding plans on an AA flight from MIA to LAX last Monday. No word back from Lost and Found. Is there anything more I can do? Please help me Reddit, you're my only hope.

Last week my fiancee and I were returning from my home country where I was showing him places to have the ceremony. There was a computer outage in Miami that stopped immigration, and then a technical issue with the flight made it so our flight was delayed.

After a 9 hour trip from Brazil to Miami then a 6 hour trip from Miami to LA arriving at 1:50am, I zoned out. I left my iPad Pro with all my contacts, plans, and photos on the seatback pocket in front of me.

We tried going to the AA Lost and Found Tuesday and were told to go to the LAX lost and found and were told to come back the next day. They didn't find anything and said they'd call us. They still haven't called us.

Called Miami Lost and Found and got an automated answering service saying to fill out a form online. Still nothing.

I activated the Lost function on Find my IPhone, but to work it needs to be connected to the Internet and the iPad was offline in the aeroplane.

I'm at a loss and it feels like I'm running around in circles. It's not the iPad, it's the data on it.

I know it's such a long shot but I can't give up yet. 

Is there anything else I can do? "

Didnt buy... forward about 5 hours later and the same flight is now $146. I scanned through the little individual price graph for each flight and it says that the price changed from $55 to $146 about 5 mins ago. I figured this must be due to cookies being stored. Cleared cookies and searched again, price was still $146 but this time, it says it has been $146 for the past few days. What is going on?

Update 1/7: since i didnt buy the ticket on saturday since i wanted to search again on sunday to see if there are any changes, sure enough, the price, as of 230pm AZ time, was at $55 for this flight. I immediately bought it. After everything was confirmed, even from AA, i did a search again for the same flight and the price had gone up to $146. even doing the search in incognito mode yielded $146.

so i guess to sum it up, make sure you are absolutely sure about when you want to travel and buy during the FIRST online search.

Flights,"Qatar Airways delayed my arrival 3 hours 50 minutes and claim they don't owe me compensation. (Complex legal technicalities) In this case the law is very confusing, I've done a lot of research and am not sure whether to give up or keep pursuing this.

I purchased a flight ticket in Ireland return. From Dublin to Doha in Qatar to Bangkok. This flight went fine.

The return portion of my flight was supposed to be Bangkok to Doha to Dublin. However the flight arrived in Doha 15 minutes late, upon exiting the aircraft a flight attendant handed me new ticket and flights no questions asked.

My new ticket was from Doha to Munich to Dublin. Apparently they did this because I wouldn't have enough time to get to the gate before original departure. (I was able to get there but not able to board because they took my old ticket.)

So I flew with Qatar airways to Munich, then in Munich I changed airlines to Lufthansa to fly to Dublin. 

At the end of this all I arrived 3 hours and 50 minutes late.

I emailed Qatar airways asking for compensation who claimed the flight had been delayed due to 'exceptional circumstances'. I then asked for the flight delay reason and they told me 'air traffic controller problems' 

I then told them under EU law they are required to provide evidence of the exceptional circumstances. They then replied saying they don't have to follow EU law because they are a 'non-EU airline' They then offered me '3000 QR' points if I sign up with their frequent flyer program, no idea what the value of that is.

I've read through the EU laws and Qatar seems to be mostly correct. However it gets confusing.

EU law states that if a non-EU airline departs from an EU country you are owed compensation. However if it departs from a non-EU country you are not owed anything.

However, remember that they changed my ticket to Lufthansa from Munich to Dublin who are an EU company.  This flight however was not late.

*I didn't give consent to Qatar airways when they changed my flight as they confiscated my tickets

* My arrival in Dublin was delayed 3 hrs 50 minutes

* I was changed to an EU airline.

Basically I'm asking, am I owed anything in this case, is there anything I can do? Or is the law a gray area here?"

This way, i can draw such a path that will encapsulate the target cities AND make the trip as cheap as possible. There is one problem though. I can't just leave the ""from"" section empty and select ""to"" section as my hometown. There is no such feature in any flight aggregator i know of. I just don't want to search for flights to my hometown from each and every European city separately.

Here is the situation: I live in Istanbul. I'd like to visit Cesky Krumlov, Salzburg, Friedrichschafen. I'm thinking of visiting Prague first because Istanbul-Prague tickets are usually cheap and return from München for the same reason. But I can't be sure! There might be better deals available.

Hey guys, I'm going on my first flight ever in about a week from today, from DFW to Portland, and I had seen an article a few days ago about American Airlines having some sort of scheduling glitch causing an extreme lack of pilots for flights. I am now horrendously anxious that my flight may end up being such a situation. Has anyone used American in the past few weeks? They said DFW is one of the prime locations that have been getting hit with the lack of pilots so I'm extremely concerned.

Flights,"Does string bags count as hand luggage or is can I bring it as a ""laptop bag""? Hello, I'll be flying on Ryanair in January. I already have a small luggage that I intend to carry-on, but I also want to bring a string bag (after measuring it by flattening it out, it's 45x35x2). However, their policy is:

All passengers (over 2 years) are entitled to one piece of hand luggage with a maximum weight of 10 kg and maximum dimensions of 55 x 40 x 20 cm. This can be taken free of charge. Also, you can have an additional piece of hand luggage on board for free. The maximum dimensions are 35 cm x 20 cm x 20 cm and the weight limit is 10 kg.

It won't have anything apart from a water bottle and a umbrella, and I can technically just fold it in half so it fits the dimensions. Would I be able to bring it on for free or would I have to pay? Thank you!"

So, I was thinking about making online booking for two persons and using a second seat as a spare space, which is usually a big deal during 7+ hours flights. I understand, that airline will cancel the second segment of my wife's ticket, so it won't work for Brussels-Moscow, but it should work on the first part of this flight, right?

I recently flew Alaska Air from SLC to SEA and had to move a flight for my wife from a Sunday evening flight to a Sunday morning flight, on Thanksgiving weekend of all times, and I called Alaska Air directly and they changed the flight for a $25 day of change. I found that to be very reasonable! Thanks Alaska!
This actually ended up being cheaper than getting the morning flight in the first place too!

Then I call today to Delta to move up a flight for me tomorrow and they say I would have to forfeit my ticket and just straight book a different flight. So just a heads up that Delta's ""basic eceonomy"" is Delta's way of saying ""nah, we don't care about the customer, pay $30-100 more to get a true economy ticket.

Alaska Air has changed me from a lifelong Delta Customer to a new customer for Alaska Air.

TLDR; Alaska Air changed flight for measly $25, Delta wanted $350 for full flight price, YAY Alaska Air!

I am a european student currently in the UK, going home over the Christmas break. I booked my plane tickets through Lufthansa in early-October. Now the flights are economy-light, and I just recently added a 23-kg baggage piece to my flights. It is far from being my first time flying, but it is the first time I am flying alone. I am a little confused about Lufthansa's baggage policy, am I allowed to take my backpack as my free hand luggage AND the checked 23 kg baggage, resulting in two pieces? I can't seem to find this information on their site.. Also I should mention that the 23kg piece is within the dimensions requested, but both my backpack and the bigger baggage exceed 150 cm in dimensions. 

My next question is: as I'll be stopping for 1h 45m in MUC, after figuring my way to the right terminal, will I have enough time to look for something to bring home? What's the general impression of duty-free shops on this subreddit? (searched for duty-free but did not help that much). Also, should I pay in pounds in MUC or exchange them into euros?

The last question is straight-forward: can I bring a box of mince pies home? Will they be taken by security because of their aluminium container? As we don't have them in my country, I would like to bring a box with me, but buying them only to be thrown away at the security doesn't sound like a great idea.

Except that the person who got my wife, our two young toddlers and I at the airport with the baby seats, turned off his phone… So we tried to contact anybody else who had two baby seats available and the space for our luggage, no answer.. Taking the bus was not an option since we got the maximum of luggages you can carry on a plane (a lot). We asked the taxi if they had any kind of service with baby seats.. no luck.
We were fucked. 

So I went to the Swiss air Staff, to ask if they would have suggestions on how to get us out of the airport.. They mentioned that we should go to an hotel that is 30 minutes away.. by taxi. So they went asking the taxi service if they had baby seats, which they didn’t. They came back telling me that the taxi service would be okay letting me sit my children without special seat, that I should go with 1 yr old child sitting on my lap. All the women of Swiss Air seemed to agree with that option, one even asked me what are the chance that something happened. They kept telling me that the service wouldn’t be concerned since it is something that happens often with tourism. We were waiting at the airport for 8 hours, so this idea almost made his way through but I kept telling my self that this was not a good idea. After many calls, I could finally find someone pick us up with special seats.

I wasn’t really happy with Swiss Air response yesterday, but this morning I woke up thinking about how shocking and irresponsible this was. I am not a physics guy, but I am pretty sure that with my weight of 85 kilo, it wouldn’t take that much of an accident to have severe consequences.

I spent 600+ euros on this flight and now, an alternative flight to the one missing costs over 1000 euros. I am broke and I can´t afford to fix this by myself

Please, help me... Please... I don´t know what to do and I am honestly losing my shit over this :( I´ll be stuck on the other side of the world for God knows how long or just waste 600+ euros on a flight I can´t take because I have no way to come back"

Flights,"What should I do if a large or obese person takes up a significant portion of my seat on a flight? I tried searching this sub for an answer to this but couldn't find anything, so sorry if this has been asked before. I went on a trip to Ghana and on my 11 hour flight from Accra to DC there was an obese guy (6' at least 450 pounds) sitting next to me. He couldn't even walk down the aisle facing forward, he had to turn sideways and shuffle with his stomach and back extending into the seats he was walking by. When he sat down he took up half of the seats next to him and was only able to put the seat rests down by sucking in and pulling in his sides. I asked the flight attendants what they could do and they said the flight was completely booked, the people in the exit rows apparently had already been asked to switch seats and refused, and that the only thing they could offer was to put me on the following flight but it was 5 days later. So I had no choice but to deal with it. His leg was under the seat in front of me and after an hour my entire left side had gone numb by the constant pressure of his body pushing into mine. I have constant back pain due to arthritis/degenerated disks/scoliosis from an accident and require narcotics just to be able to deal the with pain of flying even when I have my whole seat. I stood up, moved around, sat in he flight attendants seats as much as possible but the pain got so bad I was on the verge of tears (even though I have a high pain tolerance and have only cried from pain 2 times since I was a child.) The guy didn't even apologize once to me or the person on the other side of him despite the obvious discomfort he put us through. I mean I am completely against decriminalizing against people for the size, but I paid a lot of money for a full seat, not half of one. 
After we landed I complained to the people at the help desk who apologized but told me to call the airline's (South African Air) customer service number. So I am just wondering if anyone has any advice/legal info about what I should do and what to do if anything like that happens again. It would be greatly appreciated, thank you!!"

1. If i want to bring my dslr, should I declare it in chicago with us customs so that I have proof it was bought in the US? I don't really want customs going through my photos on my camera.

2. What's the deal with currency? I have a layover in London. Can I use my credit card and will they charge me and use the currency interest rates? How do I get local currency? Are there banks in the airport, or do I go to a bank in Budapest. I might need a couple pounds for some food and a drink.

3. I really do not want to mess with customs. I have hiking boots that i wear all the time. Will i lose them? Also do i need to lock my duffel bag? There will only be clothes/toiletries/prescription medicine in it.

1. My luggage was delivered 3 days late, damaged and torn suitcase. It was really difficult to file a report on their website - took me 3 days to do that because their website hangs halfway, does not let you upload pictures of more than 1Mb and total size of all pictures has to be less than 5Mb. Finally, I got a response saying that I had to file within 7 days which I had done - but they denied it anyway
2. I left my camera (expensive - $1500) in the plane (happens sometimes :-)) No one at the airport knew what to do, other than report it on website. Their new website keeps on crashing. Anyway, after spending an hour on phone with customer service, I got the report done. Then I heard back from them that they have found the camera. Now, I cannot get it even though I have been through the Istanbul Airport twice, because they are not giving visas to US citizens. Lost&amp;Found has given me numbers for FedEx, UPS and DHL -when I call those numbers, I just get a voicemail in Turkish - I am not sure what it says. So, here I am stuck - not knowing what to do.

I was looking to change my outbound flight from the 23rd to the 20th of December, as a flight on the 20th will be $59 cheaper. When I tried to process the change it showed the remaining balance of $59, however, I'm unsure how I'll receive that money.

Flights,"Is it worth waiting a more to try to get a lower price on a flight that is likely to not be full, or will it always get more expensive as it reaches the departure date? Hello everyone,

I have very little experience with flights, so I'm not really sure on what to do here.

I'm going from Porto to Marseille for christmas (I leave on the 22nd and get back on the 26th) and I still didn't buy the tickets. I just checked the prices, and found the best price at around 150€ for the roundtrip (from RyanAir website).

The thing is: I expected to find almost all the seats already taken, considering the departure is in a little more than a month, but, as of right now, the flight is around 80% vacant.

So, is this a sign that the price might drop as the date draws closer and the seats are not all sold; or is it always going to go up?

Sorry if this is a silly question, but any orientation is valuable. Thanks in advance!"

Flights,"Thoughts On ""Swiss International Airlines""? Hi all! 

I'm pretty happy to have found this sub! I have tried looking on reddit for quite sometime, to ask questions about airlines, flights, and such.. I travel a decent amount for my job (abroad; mainly Asia), and I am supposed to be flying to Switzerland (Zürich; 3/4 days[ish..]; end of February) for a meeting with a client, who I did some work for his company last year. I didn't end up having time to go last year, since our schedules didn't really work out. However, we did manage to get around it okay.

Anyway, I'm flying from Canada to Switzerland, and my flight options are between Air Canada, Lufthansa, SWISS, and BA. I have flown with Air Canada many times, and I have not had any issues. In fact, with me being a Star Alliance member, I have gotten my fair amount of perks! I have flown with Lufthansa before, and they are a solid choice for an airline. BA is also an option, but they aren't Star Alliance, so I tend to not go off the path too often. Finally, I have the option to fly with SWISS, which I have not flown with before. 

To be fair, with the pricing I have looked at, flying with SWISS looks like to make the most sense (money, star alliance, good times, etc). But, since I have never flown with them, I wanted to know what they are like for an airline? I know Lufthansa has ownership stakes with them, but I'm not sure what their service/flights are like. Are SWISS a good airline? Has anyone had any problems with them recently? 

Thanks a lot!  "
Flights,"Advice on United nonrev (standby) travel from Colorado to Japan last week of March? Hey there, /r/Flights!


I am planning a two week trip to Japan, flying from DEN to NRT on March 24th and coming back on April 9th. In order to make the best use of my time, I chose the non-stop United 143 &amp; United 142 respective outbound and return flights (about $1900).


However, I have an awesome family member that works for United and offered to add me to his buddy list for this flight, which would make the flight about 80% cheaper. This would be a huge savings, but at a risk. For those who don't know, flying on a buddy pass is referred to as a non-revenue ticket or ""nonrev"", meaning the airline doesn't make a profit on it. On a nonrev you fly standby, so there isn't a guarantee that you will have a seat the moment the plane boards. But if there are available seats, any standby passengers get any remaining available seats.


So my question to you all is whether or not I should take the risk of flying standby for the crazy discount. I'm trying to factor in the following:

I'm not flying over a holiday or major festival, even though it seems to be the peak of cherry blossom season and coincides with spring break.

I don't have a hotel reservation I have to stick to (staying with someone I know).

The price of a guaranteed ticket will obviously go up the longer I wait to purchase it, if that's the route I take. For the next few weeks the price shouldn't change, though.

The nonrev ticket price shouldn't change at all, even up until day-of and I don't pay for the ticket if I don't get on the plane.

When I got the offer a week or so ago, I checked on a comparable flight 3 days out on a Saturday and it still had 20+ seats available. If I am really traveling during a not busy time, the same should hold true - [this blog post appears to support the idea](http://www.clearedlist.net/fly-standby-april/).


I'm hoping you fine folks here in /r/Flights will have some good advice for me!"

I recently was searching for flights to Japan (from Australia), and used Skyscanner. My friend who lives overseas will be joining me on this trip. So basically he will be flying to Melbourne to meet me, and from here we will fly to Japan together.

The thing is when we both search for flights (we're looking at the same airlines and same flight times), the prices we are shown are quite a bit different, even taking into consideration the exchange rate.

Why is this? I've read up on fare codes and understand that, but if we're searching on the same website at the same time then does this still apply? Is it because of my browsing history that the prices I'm shown are higher, or because of our current respective locations/IP addresses?

For reference the price I'm shown is AUD1974, while his is showing RM3787 (which is around AUD1165).

Flights,"kiwi.com vs multiple airline sites I need to fly round trip to a smaller European airport from the US, and it seems that only smaller airlines fly to the airport. So I need to make a connection in Europe with a different airline.

Does kiwi.com act like a proper itinerary site, meaning there are certain guarantees in place that make it better than just booking from two airlines independently, or does it basically just purchase the separate tickets individually? I checked the two airline sites and I can book the same flights for about $420, vs $500+ on kiwi. 

I'd prefer to avoid trouble at airports, as travel is stressful enough for me, which made me think to pay the premium to book on kiwi, but if this doesn't give me any real benefits, then I'd book on the airline sites. "

Flights,"Anybody used Opodo.co.uk's 'Flexible Travel Dates' service?? Thinking of booking a flight with Opodo.co.uk because I'm not quite sure which date I'll want to return but don't want to enter the USA without a return ticket (I've heard they can send you packing because they assume you might try to outstay your visitor visa?!).

The fee just to change my ticket will be £90, plus the difference in cost of the new travel date, but Opodo.co.uk (who I've heard are a TERRIBLE company but seem to have the cheapest price here) offer a 'Flexible Travel Dates' service where, for £17.65, they will insure you against the cost of changing your flight date (up to 24hrs in advance of your ticket and less the difference in ticket cost).

Basically it looks like they're offering to eat that 'change fee', and when your budget airline charges a HUGE £90 fee it seems like it might be a sensible spend for me....

The only thing stopping me is that I've purchased 'insurance' options from companies like this before, only for them to weasel out of it via some technicality loophole and then I've basically wasted £20 buying pointless 'insurance'. The T&amp;Cs for this 'Flexible Travel Dates' deal are just legalese, probably so that people buy it and don't realise it doesn't cover them, so I'm just wondering whether anyone's already tried this (or something like it) and has actually saved a huge ticket change fee?? Or is it not worth it??

3. I have another flight departing from Bogota at 11:55.

So, if something goes wrong (delayed flight, too many lines, etc) do I have any rights? Or am I going to be screwed and find/pay for another flight on my own?

Flights,"Flying from AMS to ABQ - Checked baggage So I will be visiting my love in the US during Christmas (fkin hurray!), but I've been rather stressed out by the whole checked baggage phenomenon.

To clarify: I will fly United which allows me to bring 1x23kg on board as well as a carry-on. Since I will be staying for 16 days and would love to bring home some US products, I would like to travel with checked baggage. However, I've never done that, at least not with connected flights. My exact plan will be (all in one day):
Amsterdam -&gt; Chicago (O'Hare) -&gt; Denver -&gt; Albuquerque.
Am I correct in assuming that I need to check my luggage at Schiphol, then reclaim it and recheck it in Chicago and then do nothing except for pick it up at ABQ? I will have just under 3 hours at Chicago to catch my flight to Denver, and at Denver I will have 1 hr and 25 minutes to catch my flight to ABQ. Is that enough time to reclaim my baggage, go through customs and recheck my baggage?

This whole thing is rather stressing me out so any advice is very much welcome!"

I am going to be staying until early may, and google flights doesn't have a round trip option for that long.

A month or two ago the air India flights were around 3 or 400 one way but just checking now they seem to be around 600 . I'll check later more closely. Is air India a good airline? Will my bags be safe, nothing to be cautious of?

I'll probably try to just bring carry on, I'm going to bring a little clothes, a laptop, and toiletries/ maybe some microphones and stuff.

Flights,"Lufthansa Savings Certificate -- what's a ""gross fare""? So I missed a connection flight due to delays with Lufthansa a while back, and when I complained they gave me this ""Transatlantic Savings Certificate"" for 20% off on my next flight (which doesn't really make up for arriving 12+ hours late, but whatever, I'll take it). When I finally tried to use it now the lady on the phone explained to me that it's only for the actual ticket cost *without* the tax, making it essentially only about 10% on the full price you pay as a customer.

I feel like I'm getting shafted here but I'm trying to gather enough evidence to make a clear case for it. The [certificate's fine print](https://imgur.com/m2TwSuW) clearly says ""deduct 20% from the *gross fare*"". According to everything I have ever heard, the word ""gross"" usually means the absolute total including all sorts of things like taxes and other additional charges. When I asked the lady to double-check, she actually tried to tell me that ""gross"" means without taxes and ""net"" means with taxes (although she probably just didn't know what she was talking about or tried to bullshit me out of asking questions).

Can anyone who knows more about the airline business tell me if there's an official definition of what ""gross fare"" means, or does every airline make that up for itself? Ideally I'd love to have a link to the website of some authority (FAA?) or even Lufthansa itself where it clearly says tax should be included there, so I could call them and show them that. If they don't want to budge, do I have any chance of getting anywhere by threatening to sue or something? Or am I just going to get the ticket I really need canceled at the last minute in revenge? (The fine print also says it's all up to their decision, essentially, but I'm not sure how enforceable that is.)"

My friends and I are planning to go to Japan from December 26th, to January 6th. They have already booked their flights few months ago, and I'm looking for tickets now.

When my friends purchased their tickets in August, it was roughly $700 for a roundtrip ticket. I have been browsing for about a week now (through Expedia and Travelocity) and it seems that the current price for a roundtrip flight (JFK to HND) is between $1350-1500, which is very much so out of my $900 budget.

I looked up a flight to a different airport in Japan(NRT), and then added the bus fare that would take me to my friends at the HND airport; the price was roughly $1200.

I don't travel often, so I'm quite unfamiliar with general pricing and methods to maximize cost efficiency. I guess I have 2 questions:

1. Are the prices I'm getting fair for this time of year?

2. What are some methods I can use to stay within my $900 flight budget? (i.e. perhaps taking a flight somewhere in Japan, and using ground/misc. transportation to get to Tokyo)"

Earlier this year I went on my first independent flight from John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana, CA to San Antonio Texas. It was about a 5.5 hour flight and I realized that me and flying really don't mix all that well. Here I am, 4 months later, having to take an independent flight once more, but to Denver Colorado.

The people running are trying to get both me and my boyfriend over for free through Spirit due to their accumulated miles, however I'm just trying to disaster prep just in case that doesn't pan out. It is no carry on and economy and honestly I don't mind that if it means I don't have to blow the bank to take a trip out to Denver.

-Are there any other efficient ways to streamline the flight? 

-What should I be expecting on a 2.5 hour flight?

Flights,"Sudden spike in airfare from Denver to Vilnius in January. Anyone know what might be the cause? I know this is a long shot, but I'm just curious. I'm planning on taking a trip to Lithuania in January and have been watching fares, waiting for them to drop a bit. Or at least hoping they would. They were hovering in the low 800s and then dropped to around $750 a few days ago. Today, those exact same flights are now up to $1,200 or so. That is a tremendous jump in just a couple of days and I'm curious to find out if something happened that we know of to cause the spike? I guess I just want to know if there is a reasonable expectation of the fare dropping again in the next couple of months or if they'll continue to rise for some reason.

I didn't know who else to ask and stumbled across this sub just now and thought I'd give it a try since a Google search didn't really turn up anything. Any thoughts?"
Flights,"Ryanair Hi guys,

My wife and I have gotten caught up in the Ryanair fiasco. We were flying to Europe from the UK for a short break in December on a morning flight, planning to stay for 2 nights then come home. We were then notified that our flight was moved to the evening with a very late arrival time. As such we decided that in order to actually make the trip worthwhile we would extend our stay an extra day, so stay 3 nights instead. Well... we just got told that they've now moved us BACK to the original flight time, so no we've paid for an extra night in a hotel that we didn't want for no reason.

As you can imagine this has pissed me off to high heaven. This post is mostly in order to vent but I'd also like everyone's advice regarding any recourse we may have."

My ticket had a 100% refund if I cancelled the ticket at any time, so I cancelled the ticket and around 10 days later I received an email which said I was being issued a refund of 143 GBP. 

First of all, the paid price was 1,473 GBP, not 143 - secondly, I didn't receive that money either in my bank account. I contacted LATAM support on Facebook and they kept for over two months to give me the same answer (""Please bear with us, someone is looking into your case"" - all the time, I was never contacted again about it). 

So for the past 3 weeks I called them on the phone and they have on record that they issued me the 143 GBP refund. 
This is not true, how do I prove it? Show them a bank statement? Or get another document from the bank that proves I didn't receive any money?

They admitted there must have been some mistake though and that they need to recalculate and issue the refund, I provided them with my data (bank account, name, address) but after three weeks of follow-ups I have called again and they never get an answer from the department who should be taking care of this matter. 

Technically they have 90 days to issue the refund, the end of the 90 days is at the end of this month. 

My questions are:
- how do I prove I never received any money back?
- what is my best course of action to receive the whole amount back as I should? 
- if they exceed the 90-day term, can I ask for additional compensation and how?

My flight back is the 21st of June. So after browsing around a bit British Airways seems to be the best option for me. My father used to fly with them a lot and still has 185k avios points. I plan to fly Business Class. Google flights puts the cheapest BA Business Class flight at 1780 Euros for a roundtrip. So I checked the BA website to check how much an upgrade with avios would cost and furthermore how much a ticket costs if I buy it with avios only. So an upgrade from premium eco is 79500 points plus 4700 euros lol. Avios only is 165500 points plus 463 euros (TAX). The lowest option is 83600 points plus 2373 euros. This seems kind of steep. The final option that I figured out was a part payment via avios points, so the 1780 minus 45k points which equals to 292 euros so roughly 1,5k. I don´t fly that much and all of this confuses me quite a bit because the prices on the website of BA are so much higher than on google flights, while it is the same connection . How should I proceed? Any help is greatly appreciated!"

So I found flights from ATL to MNL for the month of January that is under $1,000 through Google Flights however we can't book it online. We have to call instead. And in light of the recent post here about the couple who's complaining CSRs mixed up their flight destination, am I right to be wary of booking over the phone or was that an isolated case?

Like any other passengers, as much as possible we want to save money but we also wanna weigh the risks of booking over the phone. We can do a cheaper flight by booking two separate flights, ATL-LAX then LAX-MNL. 

We can definitely book those online however this would be his first time flying and I just don't want him to get stranded in a foreign country or miss his second flight. So we opt for one way. Only airlines we tried that let us book online is Delta however the prices varies from $1,400 to $2,000 and that's just way too pricey

So I feel this leaves us to book over the phone. What airlines have you tried booking over the phone and it turned out fine? Are there any airlines we should avoid for a first time flyer? Or any 'upgrades' we should grab/ avoid that the CSRs are probably gonna offer?

This year I have something else in mind: living in Czech republic where the winter is kinda cold and long I am looking for a destination for my two-week vacation in February. 
The point is after searching a bit I am struggling to find cheap flights for the destination I looked into so far, so the question is: *are there any known cheap routes for that period of the year from where I live?*

**List of desired characteristics**

* mild or hot weather
* reasonably safe
* relatively cheap compared to life in Czech republic
* good nightlife
* easy to get around with English and Spanish
* welcoming to tourists 

**Optional**

* flight &lt; 10 hours one way
* presence of the sea

**Airport**

I can fly from Prague and in addition to that from the airport in Germany that are a few hours drive from here, I am adding this because probably there are more options including Germany.

**Destinations I considered**

* Cuba
* Dominican republic
* Mexico
* Colombia
* Thailand
* Philippines

Flights,"Baby due next month. What are my options for flying my family out given the uncertainty of when the child will arrive? My girlfriend is pregnant and due on November 5. We live in Los Angeles.

My family is excited to meet their grandson/nephew. They live in New York.

I'm trying to figure out the best option for them to travel out here since we can't say for sure when the baby will arrive. They can't stay indefinitely as everyone needs to minimize time off work. Here are some options I've already explored through American and United:

1. Buy a fully refundable ticket. This is absurdly expensive; it's cheaper to just buy a last-minute ticket.

2. Buy a last-minute ticket. Obviously better than option 1, but this still runs about $700 per round trip ticket. Yikes.

3. Buy tickets now and hope the baby comes on time. But changing flights incurs a $200 fee plus the difference in airfare, which is more than option 2.

4. Use rewards miles to buy them tickets now. If they have to change flights, I'd only need to make up the difference in mileage required. So if I get my mom a ticket for Nov 5 for 15K miles and my gf goes into labor on Nov 1 and a last minute ticket is 20K miles, I'd just have to fork over the additional 5K miles. But I can't make up the difference in cash, so if I don't have enough miles (like if the last minute ticket is 75K miles), then I can't do anything about it. And if she doesn't end up using the Nov 5 flight at all, I have to pay a fee of $150 to reclaim those miles or I forfeit them.

5. Use trip insurance. Buy separate flights for Nov 1, Nov 6, and Nov 11. If the baby doesn't arrive by Nov 1, cancel that flight and eat the insurance (like $50). And then repeat for the second flight, and definitely fly the third (baby can't come much later than that). The only problem is the fine print on those insurance policies; I think you can only cancel your trip if you have qualified excuses like a medical problem, etc. How stingy are airlines about using the insurance? Can you just say, ""Hey, I'm not taking this flight"", and they just say, ""You have insurance, so no worries."" This plan also requires laying out money for three flights, but that's what credit cards are for, I guess.

Does anyone have any better ideas? It doesn't seem right that families should have to choose between paying triple the normal cost of a flight or meeting their grandchild. They used to offer bereavement fares, but apparently those are gone now. I was hoping there was something similar for births. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

This is the worst company I have ever dealt and the customer service is appalling. They ruined my honeymoon and then had the audacity to give us the run around for days. After booking our honeymoon flights to San Jose, Costa Rica they charged our card twice and we never received a confirmation on our flights. We call in and after FOUR HOURS of being on the phone (after telling us we will be refunded in 7-10 business days and we can rebook our flights) we got them to rebook our flights. It was not the same flight as that was no longer available but they found us new flights out of a different close by airport on the same days. When we received our confirmations emails and all it stated was that our flight was booked to San Jose. Flash forward a few months, my husband and I get to the airport so excited to go on our once in a life time honeymoon. Flights are paid, room is paid, and we ready to relax and enjoy ourselves after all the stress we just went through in planning a wedding. Only to find out when we are on the plane that our flight is going to San Jose, California not San Jose, Costa Rica. Now mind you we get that we did get on the plane, but why should we have had any doubts on where we were going. We booked our flights over the phone with our correct destination. We had to eat the cost of our room in Costa Rica and book hotels in San Jose California, as I did not want to spend another day traveling and there were not many flights to Costa Rica at this point. Now I am out theflight cost, the room cost and I have to spend money on last minute rooms for the week. When we call Expedia to complain about our situation the customer service made us sick. Someone was rude enough to offer a $35 dollar coupon. What is that going to buy, that’s not even the cost to check a bag. When after a few MORE HOURS we finally reach a supervisor and they tell us they will need 48 hours to review our original call. They call back after 72 hours and tell us their databases delete the tapes and they don’t have any “proof” of what we requested and they will not be able to refund us. And this is after my husband was on hold for an hour. I am sorry it’s not my fault that you delete your tapes. I work in customer service and this was just disgusting. I will continue to let people know, that I haven’t already, what a horrific business Expedia is and I will NEVER EVER book with them again and let people know they should never either. 

tl/dr: Expedia booked us flights to the wrong location and we have not been able to reach anyone to rectify the situation

Hello, I'm an Israeli flying from Gdansk to Turku with Wizzair, checking in online with carry-on bag only.
My plan was to go straight through security to the gate.
However, I noticed on their website that non-EU citizens are required to have their passport and visa checked, and their boarding pass stamped, or else it would be invalid and boarding could be denied.
I haven't actually printed my boarding pass yet because online check-in is still closed.

So here are my questions:
- What happens if I use a mobile boarding pass? How do you stamp those? Is Mobile boarding pass even available in Gdansk airport?

- How strictly is it enforced? 

- My flight is early in the morning, so I would appreciate saving time and not have to be present in the airport earlier than necessary. Waiting in line for the check in desk can be troublesome. 
However, I land in the same airport a few days earlier so I figured, would it be possible to have it checked and stamped in advance?
Alternatively, can in be done in the city terminal a day before the flight?
What can you tell me about the terminal in Gdansk city centre? What services to they provide. I know Wizz has representatives there but do they offer check in services?
Or better yet, Wizz also have desks in Tel Aviv Ben Gurion airport. I actually fly to Gdansk with Lot and not Wizz, but perhaps I could take care of it as soon as possible?

On a different subject: Middle name
My brother has one(we're flying together), it's on the passport but I didn't know when booking so it's not on the ticket.
i.e John Smith on the ticket, John Patrick Smith on the passport.
I know it's been asked many times, just from a quick search I found dozens of answers. Everybody said they had never had a problem.
But when I wrote Wizz and Lot, they both said I should change the name, and of course they want a fee that is higher than the price I paid for the tickets. 
I'm not willing to pay that as a matter of principle but I don't want any trouble.
Did they give me that answer just so I pay the fee or is it really a big deal?

6 or 7 days from arrival time I want to fly to Brisbane Australia.
Price Info.  Looking for something cheap.

For example I noticed this direct flight to Brisbane for about $600 CAD. 
[flight!](http://ca.ceair.com/en/booking.html?fromValue=YYZ&amp;toValue=BNE&amp;fromLabel=TORONTO%20PEARSON%2C%20YYZ&amp;toLabel=BRISBANE%2C%20BNE&amp;travelType=oneway&amp;date1=1512277200000&amp;adult=1&amp;child=0&amp;infant=0&amp;byPoints=false&amp;isRequery=false&amp;flightClass=)

If anyone has any ideas I am interested.  I am not committed to China, but would love to visit a major Asian city.  It could be Japan/South Korea or anything really.  Just want to experience somewhere interesting and within a reasonable budget.  Less than $1000 or so would be amazing for Toronto-Asian City- Brisbane Australia would be amazing.

Flights,"Is it possible that the airline finds the checked luggage while the airport services couldn't? tl;dr title

Hey r/ flights.

Three days ago, on Monday 25th, I was travelling with eurowings/germanwings from Warsaw Chopin (WAW), through Dusseldorf (DUS) to Birmingham International (BHX). While giving my luggage to the lady at the eurowings check-in counter in Warsaw I was told that I will not have to reclaim my bag in Dusseldorf and send it its way again towards Birmingham.

The sticker I've been given at the counter says
&gt;TO BHX 4U 9334

&gt;VIA DUS EW 9725 

In Birmingham, however, the bag was not on the carousel at all, which I have reported to the airport staff at the ""Arvin Aviation"" counter.

I have been given a tracking number of some sorts for the worldtracer site, where I've been tracking the progress, or lack of it in this case, of finding my luggage. The status has been
&gt; Tracing Continues. Please Check Back Later

for two days, after that, I had to fill out a form of what does my bag look like, what are the contents of it, etc.

Now, the status is
&gt; Inventory Received / Tracing Continues. Please Check Back Later

Accoring to the internet, eurowings will be in charge of finding the luggage starting tomorrow. Can they actually, realistically, find the bag themselves? Or am I just being delayed for additional two weeks for no reason? Or maybe I've done something wrong on the way there and it's my fault the bag wasn't available in BHX? It's the first time I've travelled with eurowings, before that I was flying exclusively with Brussels Airlines, and I've had no such problems with them on this route.

Thank you."
Flights,"I Bought Airline Tickets, The Airline Goofed, And They're Trying To Charge Me to Fix Their Mistake. Hello!

On 20 September, I purchased two tickets from an airline (let's call them… Sprint.) The first was from BOS-BWI, takeoff on 6 October 2017, for about $130. The second was from BWI-BOS, takeoff on 9 October, 2017, for about $45. Not too long after booking, I received a confirmation email, stating that these were the two flights I was booked for. The $180 has cleared from my account. I logged on to Sprint.com later to see when I would be able to print my boarding passes, and they had me listed as departing on the 8th- same flight number, just different date and time. I called them to confirm that I was flying out on the ninth, and they stated that I was flying out on the eighth, and would have to pay $140 to change it to the ninth. I asked how much it would be to cancel, and they stated there was a $200 cancellation charge.

After complaining on Twitter, (because apparently, that's how we do things in 2017) They offered to waive all rescheduling fees, but I would have to pay the fare difference - which as of my posting this, is now $101 more than I already paid. While $101 doesn't seem like much, I've been saving up for this trip for six months, and only budgeted $200 for transportation anyway.

Is there anything I can do? This isn't a rant, and I'm not looking for a free flight, or to ""game the system,"" or whatever - I purchased a flight for 9 October, Sprint accepted my money and sent me a receipt, and now they (whether maliciously or through a software glitch, who could know) have changed the service that I purchased, and want an extra $100-$300 to fix their error. Please help, and thank you!

This is cross-posted from r/legaladvice because this is just as much a customer service issue as a legal one.

Flights,"Is Premium Economy worth it? I've been doing more travelling, but still not enough to have any status on a FFP yet, but getting close.  2 return trans-pacific flights, and 2 return Toronto to LA flights in the last 6 months.  I've always flown economy as I've never been able to rationalize flying business class before.   

However, I am looking at EVA Air's Premium Economy.  It seems to only be $400 more roundtrip.  Is it worth it?  For me, the biggest issue with travelling is that I can't sleep on planes.  I know Premium Economy is a higher pitch, I think for EVA Air it's 37, compare to regular economy of 31.  This will be a Toronto to Bangkok flight.

Has anyone flown premium economy and found the higher pitch worth it for sleeping?  Or heck what about food and amenities?"
Flights,"Possibly dumb question about my checked bag. So basically the rundown is I have a flight going into Boston with JetBlue. Later that same day I'm flying out of the same airport but with Wow Airlines. The Wow Air is an international flight. Will I need to claim my checked bag, check it again with Wow Air, and go through security again? Or is there any chance those bags will be transferred over to my international flight? Is this just something I need to ask when checking my bag for my first flight with JetBlue? Sorry for the possibly stupid question. Just making sure I know what to do when the time comes."
Flights,"Price increased between me pressing submit and my credit card being charged. Just had an odd/interesting experience booking a flight.  I was booking directly on the airlines website for two round trip tickets.  Entered all my traveler and seat selection info, hit next, and entered my payment info.  After submitting my payment I was greeted with a page that said something along the lines of 'seats or prices have changed, please go back'.

Went back and the price had gone up by $40 per seat.  Called customer service and the response was basically 'Tough luck.  If you notice the price goes down between now and the flight, call us and we'll give you a credit for your next flight with us."" 

I did the recommended techie tips of clearing cookies, using incognito modes, using a VPN, etc..  I checked other aggregate sites like google flights and momondo.  The price legitimately went up by $40 a seat during the time it took me to enter my credit card number.  

I get it, prices change and I have no control over when they make those changes, but it was a bit frustrating that I had the flights and seats selected, hit next, then entered my payment info.  In my opinion, those seats at that price should have been locked in once I made it to the payment page and my session didn't expire.  It's not like I picked the flight and seats 4 hours ago and just got back to my computer to buy them.  We are literally talking about no more that 60 seconds.

Anyway, it is what it is.  What I found even more interesting is that not all seat prices increased.  The price apparently went up on all seats except one.  I was able to book a single seat at the original price and then book my second seat through a separate transaction for $40 more.  I now have two tickets for the exact same seat numbers I selected during my first attempted transaction.

I'm really confused at why the price of all but one remaining seat went up in price.  It's not like I was being charged a premium for the convenience of picking adjacent seats.  If that were the case my 2nd ticket should have cost as much as the 1st.

In short, I guess it may make financial sense to look for tickets individually rather than as travelling with one or more other travelers.

My best friend was supposed to be getting married in Puerto Rico on Oct. 22 and I booked my flight in June from Oct. 19 - 24 with American Airlines through a German cheap flight aggregator (I'm an American living in Germany). My friend called off the wedding right around when Irma grazed the island, but I was going to go anyway for my own holiday instead of requesting a flight credit. But now Hurricane Maria has devastated Puerto Rico and the power is supposedly going to be out for months. Trump has declared a state of emergency there and FEMA has been called in. My flight is still a month away (and who knows if another hurricane will hit) but will airlines continue to fly to the island in a state of disaster or is there any chance they'll cancel commercial flights and I'll get a refund? I'm keeping an eye out for announcements from AA but haven't read of anything yet, there are only travel alerts to change itineraries without fees up to September 30. Since I booked via a 'travel agent' I don't think AA will even talk to me on the phone, they will just refer me back to the agency where I booked the ticket since I didn't book with AA directly, so that's why I'm hoping for them to just cancel it on their own."

I am looking at flying into Maputo from London which is currently around £540 leaving on the 18th October (returning next February).

Does anyone have experience of these situations and has any advice on the best way that they have found to handle it?

I have a few scenarios which I am worried about:

1. I just book the flights and lose the money if the VISA is declined.
2. If i don't book the flights, the price drastically changes before the VISA is granted and then I have to pay far more.
3. I have to pay to reserve flights resulting in the flights being far more expensive and less competitively priced anyway due to the companies that will allow them to be reserved.
4. I just book the flights but can get them insured against this - However I guess this may be expensive?

£500ish is a price I can afford whereas £700+ I cannot so I'm not sure if there is an *ideal* way to go about this situation or if it's just picking the option I'm happiest with and going for it.

I have read that i can get compensation under EU law up to 250€, but i am wondering what is my best plan of action.

1. Get a refund, then claim.
2. Book a ticket later (19 hours later), than claim.
3. The above will invalidate my claim, just do nothing and claim after the flight should have left.

Update: I talked to both [Citizens Advice](https://www.citizensadvice.org.uk/consumer/holiday-cancellations-and-compensation/if-your-flights-delayed-or-cancelled/) and the UK European Consumer Centre. They couldn't really say much, other than if i get the refund i invalidate my right to follow up on the 250 € under Under EU Regulation 261/2004. If I rebook on their site for monday, and use that, I am over the arrival deadline and they have to follow through. 
If i don't use the new ticket, i get nothing. She reccomended me to have proof of trying to communicate, so ill at least be able to slap that in their face. 
Soo kind of fucked since i am on a deadline.

I didn't do anything with Ryanair. I booked a ticket next day with easyjet, and then googled ""eu rule 261/2004 ryanair"" which gave me [this](https://www.ryanair.com/gb/en/useful-info/help-centre/faq-overview/flight-delays/eu-regulation-261) site to send in my claims. I claimed first for my expences for the new ticked and the hotel night i missed, and then on the next form I claimed for the 250€. Since they don't have a contact mail, in the 250€ claim I wrote that i had been trying to get in touch without luck, and needed a new ticket fast, so i did it myself. So ill see what sticks. "

Flying Qatar, their customer service has been very spotty on getting me in the right direction.

My item is 84cm x 65cm x 68cm and 9kg. Item could be smaller without the box.

Upon checking their website it says maximum dimensions for checked item is 158cm of L+ W + H. 
Therefore they said since my item(217cm) exceeds the 158cm limit I would need to use Qatar Cargo to ship it back.

That's when I stumbled upon the sporting equipment. It says maximum dimensions is 217cm with a maximum weight of 15kg for small items.

What is considered sporting equipment in this case? Will my item fit the requirements for this?

Flights,"Advice for trip planned to Key West I'm hoping someone who is familiar with flying can help answer some questions I have. 

My fiance and I are getting married in a month and have planned a honeymoon in Key West. (great idea now, right?) We booked it months ago. With much damage from the hurricane, we're thinking of cancelling and going elsewhere. The issue is the flight.

We booked a flight and B&amp;B through Expedia. We were told that if we cancelled the B&amp;B by October 1st we would get a full refund. As for flight--flight there is through JetBlue Airways. Departing Detroit and arriving in Ft Lauderdale with a 5 hour layover. Then to Key West. Flight home is direct from Key West to Detroit through Silver Airways. When my fiance called Expedia they told him that we would not be able to get a refund for the flight, but be able to use these tickets at a later date within a year. We would also need to pay another additional $75 per ticket. And I believe we would need to also pay the difference if the new tickets were more expensive. He purchased insurance on the tickets as well.

I just don't know what to do. There's almost no information on his Expedia acct aside from our itinerary. There's no breakdown of what we paid either. Is there a way we can cancel the flight and be able to get a full refund? Thank you in advance."

My question is specifically about the flight deals to Europe that they advertise. They consistently send around outstanding deals to Europe in the ""400's/500's"". And while that is certainly a great deal, there are airlines (namely WoW and Norwegian) that actually offer cheaper fares than that (200's/300's/sometimes less) almost all the time. 

Just the other day, I looked up a flight to Rome for later this year and the total -- for two people round trip -- was $750. Could do that with a bunch of different cities. 

Anyway, I'm just curious if anyone knows why they don't more actively advertise these deals or promote them because it strikes me that these are actually the best deals to Europe. 

If Scott's Cheap Flights reads this: I love you don't hate me I'm genuinely curious. "

Flights,"Advice for Flight to Savannah GA - currently being evacuated ahead of hurricane Irma So I have a non-refundable one way ticket to Savannah, GA for tomorrow morning (sept 8th). 

Due to the impending hurricane the wedding has been rearranged for a smaller scale in another location that I won't be taking part in so I don't need to reschedule my flights. I just need them cancelled. 

The problem is that even though Savannah is already under mandatory evacuation, the airlines have only issued a travel alert and not a cancellation so I can't get a refund and the travel alert only applies to rescheduled flights that take place before Sept 30th (which I have no use for because I can't request time off work on that short of notice). 

When they eventually call me back in 2 hours, is there any chance of me being able to reason with them that I should get a refund since no one in their right mind is flying into an evacuation site? My concern is that because the weather is still technically clear tomorrow when the flight is supposed to occur, that they won't cancel it because they still need to get the planes there to get flights out even if no one is on the plane in (if that makes any sense).

This is what I get for having lived in the midwest for enough years that I've forgotten to account for hurricane season and not just snow when deciding whether to buy travel insurance."

Qantas are currently having a double points offer for 5 days on Qantas/Emirates network flights, as well as double status credits for all Qantas operated flights.

We got the news yesterday that my grandpa is in the hospital and is in a bad shape. My dad wants to go there to see him (possibly for the last time...) but in the worst case scenario that my grandpa passes away, he would want to attend his funeral as well, but of course, we wouldn't know when that would be planned, having to account for other relatives flying over there as well.

He will most likely leave sometime next week, but I'm unsure what kind of return I should book him. I saw there is a flexible ticket, but this tends to be way more, around double the ticket price I found him for. 

Let's say I book him a flight from Tuesday 5th with a return on Tuesday the 19th and within this period, my grandpa's situation worsens and he has to change his flight ticket. Would it be better to have booked through the airline as opposed to some other third party ticket seller?

A little more concisely: I'm wondering about which option is the best

1. Book flexible ticket (through airline) (by far most expensive, like 2000?) 
2. Book non-flexible ticket through airline (more expensive, around 900-1000?): Should be easier to change / cancel, but maybe more expensive than buying another ticket with option 3?

3. Book non-flexible ticket not through airline itself (around 500-600?): The cheapest option, but I think changes would be hard as the third-party seller needs to be contacted instead of the airline itself?

4. Book two oneway tickets (I'm not sure if this is possible or would cause trouble at the US customs)

5. Fly twice in case my grandpa passes away (this makes sense somewhere, but probably a pain in reality)

According to IAH's Twitter feed, limited operations have resumed.

If the flight is cancelled they will allow up to 7 day delay in departure. If not cancelled they will charge a fee of $250 to $500 each, depending on the particular days. Every agent and supervisor I've talked would not budge on this policy.

Flights,"Is it worth it to complain after a night mare trip? I recently had a night mare getting home from a trip that had me, as a strong 21 year old man absolutely bawling my eyes out at 3 airports around the world. I am wondering if I should complain and if the outcome will be worth it. For the record: my flight path was supposed to be beirut-paris-montreal-orlando, I ended up with beirut-paris-detroit-orlando.

I had a flight from Beirut to Paris on mea/air France. That flight was delayed which made me miss my next flight from Paris to Montreal on air canada. I went to the help desk in Paris and told them what happened.. they told me that there were two options. Stay in Paris for 24 hours with a hotel room, or stay in Montreal 24 hours with no hotel room. The lady told me to think about it for 5 minutes and come back. When I got back 5 mins later there was a huge line, and it took almost 2 hours to be seen. The lady I spoke to earlier was gone and, I was told that they would not give me a hotel room even in Paris. I was forced to get a hotel room out of my own pocket.

The next day comes and I get on my flight to Detroit. In Detroit I am told that my bags are missing. I rush to my gate and try to get on my flight home to orlando, and they won't let me. They say that the boarding pass I have is not valid and there was never a reservation for me. After playing a bit of telephone with the airlines they put me on a flight the next day, a whole 24 hours later- to Orlando.

Now almost 2 weeks later I am still fighting to get my luggage, that included 100% of my clothes. I feel sooooo absolutely screwed by everyone. I was so sad, depressed, and beat down. I had the same clothes on for about a week. I want some form of compensation. But most of all I just want someone to say sorry to me. I was left homeless in two unfamiliar airports with nothing. Will complaining get me anywhere?"

However, recently there have been some really foggy conditions which are affecting morning flights (which her first flight is), and many of them are getting delayed many hours (until the afternoon!).

If this were to happen when she flies and she misses her second flight, what can she do?

I know that when the connecting flight is with the same airline or partners or w/e they can just put you on the next available flight. But in this case, when both airlines and flights are ""independent"" of each other, what can she do?

Would the first airline sort it out? Or the second airline? Or is she screwed?"
Flights,"Upgrade Availability? Check in late? Be last to board? Hi Guys,

So I purchased a three segment ticket from US with a layover in Minneapolis and Amsterdam to Prague. My ticket number starts with KLM but it is operated by Delta Airlines.

So on Delta website, I chose my seats with the windows because I feared that that I might be stuck in middle seats which will be just terrible.

I read on some websites that if you check in or arrive at departure line late, there maybe a chance for you to upgrade if your seating is taken or the tickets are oversold.

I chose the seats because worst comes to worst I will just be in Economy seat with the seating I chose. But I was wondering if I should check in early a day before or check in once I get to the airport.

I'm guessing the best route is check in once I get to the airport, and wait until end of the line to get on the plane. I don't have a specific date to land in Europe anyways. Plus I have to check in a bag anyways so I guess it won't make a difference.

I know there is like a very slim chance, but why I wondered why not try it. 

Thank you all

Flights,"Problem with changes made by the airline I booked a flight from Barcelona to Kuala Lumpur with a layover in London in early June. 10 days ago I got an email from Hotwire (who I booked the flights through) saying to call them about changes that Malaysia Airlines made to the flight out of London.

They changed the time of the flight out of London to before my flight from Barcelona leaves.

I called Hotwire about this multiple times and spent at least 3 hours on the phone with different CSRs. They all told me a lot of conflicting things - some told me to get my flight changed through the airline (when I did the airline told me it needed to be changed through Hotwire). Some offered to change my 2nd flight time and then either went back on it or told me they needed to contact Malaysia Airlines about it.

The CSRs from Malaysia Airlines told me that there is another flight from London to Kuala Lumpur the next day and there shouldn't be any reason that Hotwire can't just put me on that flight instead. I asked 2 CSRs from Hotwire about this and they confirmed that there is another flight to Kuala Lumpur the next day but then basically dicked around and failed to put me on that flight instead without a solid answer as to why.

At that point I basically gave up and decided to ask Hotwire for a refund (one of the CSRs I talked to before had mentioned giving me one). So I called and told them I wanted a refund, at which point they said they were calling Malaysia Airlines to ask if I can get one, then called me back like 45 minutes later saying they'll get back to me about it on Monday.

I feel like I was relatively patient with everyone I talked to - I was pretty annoyed at some points, but I never yelled at anyone I talked to. I would've been totally fine with flying out of London a day late, which a lot of people wouldn't have wanted to deal with.

I never asked to be bumped to first class or for a free hotel room or anything like that, I just kept asking them to change my second flight to one I can actually make.

One of the Hotwire CSRs I talked to even tried to change my 2nd flight to an even earlier one, like she had absolutely no comprehension of what the problem was even with my itinerary in front of her. It's totally bizarre.

Any thoughts on all this? Advice?"

Pretty dumb question but this is my first time with KLM to go to Prague, Czech Republic from Southern California. 

I'm going to be in an Economy seat but I'm confused as which baggage policy I need to follow. From Southern California to layover in Minneapolis to Amsterdam is operated by Delta Airlines. 

From there, Amsterdam to Prague is operated by KLM.

I never really had to pay for my baggage this this kind of sucks but it seems like $25 bucks for Delta and $40 bucks of KLM.

But since my baggage will be checked in the whole time and I won't need it until Prague, hopefully I will only have to pay it once.

Sorry if the question sounds stupid.

Flights,"YYZ &gt; AKL: American or Air NZ? I was looking to book my flight today and now the price for the Air NZ option is cheaper. They're about $100 difference, but I'd rather pick the ""better"" option regardless...

American is YYZ &gt; LAX &gt; AKL.
Air NZ is YYZ &gt; YVR &gt; AKL.

American is on the new dreamliner, whereas I've already flown Air NZ on the 777. I guess with this air NZ option it could be a little faster without USA precheck, but that may ultimately be a minor issue. By far my biggest concern about Air NZ is their ""strict"" carry on baggage, whereas american details size but no weight restrictions.

I think American opened up this new route to AKL just last year, so it's new on a new plane.

When trying to call back Fly Jamaicas customer service line closes at 10pm.

After no one answering phones at both of their Guyana offices, we drove to one of their offices and were told they were trying to charter a plane for us to fly out today August 23rd. They told us to call them before 4pm (when they close) to find out. When we tried, no one answered.

Come today they don't have a plane, and don't have any set time or date to give us a return flight, with alot of maybe tomorrow, and maybe Friday.

I read their contract of carriage here:
https://www.fly-jamaica.com/travel-info/legal/contract-of-carriage

And it says we have the right to go on another airlines flight to the same route if we are not satisfied with their charter, when I told the people working at the office, they said the main office in Kingston has denied them doing that. I tried calling Kingston to speak to a Ms. Cain, was denied, they took my number never called me back.

I have now requested a refund (6 to 8 weeks for refund) and am paying a MORE expensive fare for a one-way trip back to Canada with a competitor that lands 4 days later than my original return. Which has resulted in my mom and I losing working days, as well as 2 interviews I had set up.

Flights,"Flying American. Can I bring/wear an Ostrich pillow in addition to my carry-on and personal item? I'm not an experienced flyer. This will be my first really long flight across the country with a lay-over, so about 9 hours of travel total and it's in the middle of the night. I would very much like to sleep on these flights.

Someone bought me an [Ostrich pillow](https://media.firebox.com/product/6326/column_grid_8/the-original-ostrich-pillow_7399.jpg) that I've never used and thought it might be perfect for this. But I'm not sure if this will count as an extra item and I'll be forced to check one of my bags which I want to avoid.

The Ostrich pillow has no eye holes so I can't actually wear it while walking onto the plane. I am bringing a carry-on and a personal item that will already be full.

If this is a bad idea, I'll just get one of those neck pillows at the airport and leave the Ostrich pillow at home. But I've seen other people with regular bed pillows on flights and always wondered if that was allowed or if they counted that as the person's personal item."

I called the airline about this, and they said they see my middle name in the ""secure flight data"" sent to TSA, but they're not sure if it will print on the boarding pass. The airline rep said they thought I'd be fine, but I want to make sure this isn't just a ""TSA agent probably won't bother you because they usually don't care"" sort of thing.

First flight is at 00:10, and since I'm only bringing carry on, I naturally checked in and got my boarding pass, easy as expected. Next flight is at 07:50, and whilst Aeroflot allowed me to check-in and select my seat, no boarding pass for the second flight is available. (And as a minor confusion, Aeroflot's boarding passes have the same pass printed twice in the PDF, so I initially thought I got both)

Have anyone else experienced having to actually get tickets at a transfer desk/computer before? I always knew they existed, but never in any of my many many flights have I needed to use it, so I almost assumed they weren't a thing anymore and it was just leftover signage at the airport.

Flights,"I'll know if I'll be able to fly only 1-2 weeks in advance - how to minimize the booking price? I know my exact destination and date from now, but not if I'll have the time to go there.

Since ticket prices, from what I read, are usually sky-high that late, I've been thinking of booking well before that and cancelling my flight if I'm unable to go. Sure, there's some fee, but it's better than either not going or booking the flight in vain. On the flipside not every airline has cancellation options, so that means my options are limited. (I don't have a frequent traveller status or anything of sorts anywhere.)

And then I'd most likely have to make a connection. This is a first-time for me - how do cancellations work when there's a connection? Am I only able to book a connection within the same airline or cooperating airlines? In case of booking the legs seperately, is 6hrs - 12hrs usually enough time in event of a delay? (It looks like most of my layovers would be in that time range.)

I don't know how much in advance I'll know my schedule, but in case I go for the other route, how much do prices rise in general 2 weeks before the flight? Or 1 week?

Flights,"PSA: Economy Plus is not Premium Economy I work in travel management and we are receiving many complaints from corporate and personal travelers who do not research the differences between these services.

American Main Cabin Extra (MCE), Delta Comfort Plus (Comfort+), United Economy Plus (Economy+) are economy cabin seats with some enhancements, they are not comparable to true premium economy service from airlines such as BA or Lufthansa.

In the last year we have seen several corporations convert from Premium Economy services on European airlines to Economy Plus on American airlines based on ""better pricing"". This is a downgrade. These services are not equal, American MCE can't compare to BA World Traveller Plus, United EconomyPlus can't compare to Lufthansa Premium Economy.

Unfortunately, this is catching out many unfamiliar corporate travellers who are not aware these Economy Plus seats are vastly inferior with much reduced leg room and seat width as well as regular Economy food and drink.

If you do have any say in choosing between these services or influencing your corporate travel agreements, please compare products directly rather than assuming equivalence from names.

Although I always remind any personal travelers I am looking after, not all agents are doing this as our commission is fee and not based on price, so personal travelers used to European standards are also being disappointed after flying the American choices."

The short story is that we were supposed to leave at 12:40pm and were delayed until 5pm. We board the plane and get settled. We're waiting for like 20 mins and the pilot comes on over the PA and says they have a legal issue due to time. Not sure if they can take off. 10 mins go by and he comes back on and says they can't leave and are looking for another crew. They don't find one and inform us the flight is cancelled. 

At this point the flight attendant comes on the PA and apologizes. She goes on to say something to the effect of ""I want to be honest with everyone here. The reason for the delay is because the pilots were dragging their feet, taking their time walking to the gate so that the flight would be delayed on purpose. Your flight crew did everything possible to make this flight happen. So everyone, make sure you give a special thank you to the pilot on the way out of the plane"".

I'm moving overseas in about a month. I have two laptops, and I've read an awful lot of fuss about laptop theft in checked luggage.

The laptop with all my documents / research will go in my carry-on. The other, I thought I would secure with a cable in my checked baggage (see above link for the imgur pic; carry-on weight limit is 12 kg, and I have to carry more electronics, and my jewelry besides, in there). 

The checked-baggage laptop will have its battery removed, and be in a soft case, surrounded by tightly-packed clothing. The airline (Condor) has told me that a battery-less laptop in checked luggage is fine, though how they determine that the battery is removed ...? I don't know.

Flights,"Austin to Hong Kong. Travel times, flight logistics, etc What are my options here? I reside in Austin and my fiance is from Hong Kong.  I've traveled some from Hawai'i to Japan which was a nice and short flight.  Last year I did a 24+ hour deal from Austin to South East Asia (Philippines, Indonesia, and Malaysia) and it's rather brutal.  

With all that said I've done a lot of research and it appears HK isn't a popular hub unlike Tokyo, Seoul, etc.
Option wise I've considered spending the $800-$900 on a 20 ish hour round trip flight to HK.  However, Tokyo is only 12-15 hours away (I was thinking round trip from Tokyo to HK, etc), and that's also on the plate.  We're in our mid 20s and really budgeted--yet we'd like to have a less hellacious flight and I sense there might be leeway.

All considered are there any tricks I'm missing?  I see Tokyo flights command a premium and HK flights do not.  It's sort of the paradox I found for a flight from Austin to Jakarta--super cheap, however, it's likely because few want to go there!   

Past that I've thought of a 24ish hour layover/stretch legs in a mid point but I'm not sure.  Flights to Tokyo are really $$$ from what I am seeing (yet HK flights usually have a layover in like NRT, HND, etc).  Houston is cheaper to fly out of and worth considering but still Japan demands a strict premium.  Some layovers are in other countries and I've yet to examine them.  

In the end I am perplexed on my next best move here...
Any hints, input, or suggestions would be greatly appreciated--as we're planning things out and I've researched but it's difficult understanding every angle of the situation.  Budget wise I'd like to keep it under $1000 per ticket.  She's told me flights could be cheaper if booked on a Chinese website and we've yet to examine that option yet.  

My gut feeling says we should just fly from AUS to DFW to HK flight wise, as it's only a few hours longer, and it's right now $865.  But then again--we would like to honeymoon in Japan, and perhaps we can somehow have two round trip loops--I'm not sure honestly..."
Flights,"Qatar Airways - flying with diabetes (mediacal supplies) Hello,

 I am flying with Qatar Airways through Doha to my holiday destination and I am taking all diabetes supplies with me. But when I packed it up, it looks like whole hand baggage is full of diabetes supplies. I need to take them in hand baggage because I do not want to risk lost or damaged baggage which would leave me without diabetes supplies and also I need to use them during flight. And also insuline can not be stored in low temperatures under 2 Celsius.

I am on Medtronic pump which I alway carry with me attached to my body. Therefore I am taking:

1. Main insulin pump attached to my body, backup insulin pump
2. 3 * insuline Humalog in vials to fill reservoirs for insuline pump
3. 10 * Infusion set for insuline pump in one box, 10 * Reservoir for insuline pump in one box
4. One backup AA battery for insuline pump
5. Backup insuline pens with long-term insuline Lantus in original package
6. Backup insuline pen with few original needles
7. Short-term insuline Humalog in 5 cartriges for backup insuline pen 
8. Glucose meter with 3 packages of test strips
9. Backup glucose meter with 3 packages of test strips
10. GlucaGen HypoKit injection

It seems to me like I am carrying to much and it can cause troubles at airport security, but until now I was only traveling around Europe so I had easy access to all supplies or short way home in case of something would go wrong. 

Everything is in original unopenned packages and I am taking letter from doctor where are all these supplies stated, but there is no international guide how this letter should like. And my doctor has no experience with it at all, so he has just downloaded and edited ""some"" letter from internet and put her stamp on it. 
Am I carrying to much supplies in hand baggage?"

Situation: I live in the US (Seattle) and my girlfriend lives in Frankfurt, Germany. I'm moving to China (Qingdao) at the end of the month or first week of September.

Flights,"How does full fare / fully refundable travel work in the real world for people who regularly travel it? For example, for the people who post here or on FlyerTalk that they ""only travel Y"" or ""only travel Y-UP""? For example, I read a lot about companies getting huge discounts on full fare flying, but it's all very vague. How big are the discounts? Do you have to be spending millions to get the highest discounts or can smaller companies get good discounts if they commit to exclusivity? Does the dollars spent per passenger have any bearing versus just the total company spend?

I have also read the publicly available information and some FlyerTalk threads about the current American AAirpass program. People talk about 10-15% discounts. Could they possibly be higher discounts if you have a higher commitment or agree to exclusivity or something? Could they have other benefits like ability to book lower fare classes with your AAirpass credits and discount?

I am also curious as to how Y fares are justified in almost any case, even with say a 15% discount that people on this forum have mentioned with regards to AAirpass. I just checked on the AA booking site and Y fares ORD&gt;LAS were $2,400 one way. Even at 15% off, in my experience you can buy tickets for much cheaper than that even the day before your flight. I am getting the clear impression based on reading things online that there are travelers that just ALWAYS book Y fares even if they are booking several days ahead, but the numbers aren't adding up. If you're only getting a 15% discount on those Y fares you might as well buy the cheapest fare you can find and take your chances with change fees. Hell with elite status, even with a discount fare don't you get free same day guaranteed flight changes? 

I am missing part of this picture because the numbers just aren't adding up. You would have to be getting 60%-70% discounts for Y fare to make sense in most cases even for a regular last minute traveller. The Y fares are so high that if you are 2+ people it might be cheaper to charter a private jet for last minute travel. ORD&gt;LAS you probably would need 6-8 travelers and chartering would be cheaper versus that published Y.

Now the H fare ORD&gt;LAS was ""only"" $1,100 one way but at least through AAirpass, you're only allowed to book that fare 7+ days in advance. The H fare seems to make slightly more sense but people don't talk about flying H, they talk about flying Y.

Another question I have regarding flying full fare in practice regards the refundability of the tickets: since they are 100% refundable without any fees, is there any other mechanism that prevents people from just booking a seat in every single flight that they have the slightest interest in possibly traveling? For example say I had an AAirpass agreement and wanted to book H 7 days in advance to save money but I wasn't sure exactly which dates or times. What stops me from just booking every single flight available over the course of several days to make sure that I have a seat reserved on each one?"

I don't travel much so although I read *some* things in FAQs along with other sties that touch on the subject, I just like to get direct answers to my personal questions as it contains a few more specifics. 

From what I've read, it seems my layover may be a little on the short side considering I'm connecting to an international flight. I'm just worried that I might miss my flight and also not sure if I would have to pick up my checked luggage. 

Here's the situation: 

I am flying Delta and trip was booked on one round trip (Note: all times Eastern).

- I'm supposed to depart from Miami International Airport on a Wednesday at 8:40 AM and arrive at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 10:31 AM.

- There is supposed to be a 1 hour and 13 minute layover in ATL. 

- After the layover, the next leg of the trip is from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta Intl at 11:44 am to leave for Narita International Airport.

If you have flown via Delta or have experience at ATL, do you think that layover is enough time for me to catch my flight to Japan, especially considering it's an international flight? Do I have to go through customs or another security check?  

I'll ask again at the counter when I get to the airport but does anyone know if I would have to collect my checked luggage from my Miami flight in ATL as both flights are Delta and they were purchased on the same ticket? Or will Delta automatically send my luggage to the next flight? How long does that process usually take? This might actually influence if I decide to take a checked luggage or not.  

I know the FAQ touched on this briefly but I'm hoping I can get more specific answers to my questions. I'm an international travel newbie, so I am just trying to be extra sure.

I recently booked a round trip ticket with Singapore Airlines from Houston to Manchester for a vacation with my wife. I ended up having to travel for work before that so wouldn't require the first leg. Knowing that you can't just not show up for a leg of a flight and expect to get on the next leg, I called and informed them that I wasn't going to be on the first flight but would like to use the second leg. They said, no problem, we'll issue you a new booking. I was surprised there was no cost involved but a few minutes later I had a new booking number showing a single segment with status ""confirmed."" Awesome… new favorite airline. Well, travel day arrives and I'm denied a ticket because I didn't use the first leg of my round trip ticket. I produced the new booking reference, which they confirm exists but that it is ""impossible."" Apparently the reservation system wasn't talking to the ticketing system that day or some other internal breakdown. After shelling out the cost of a last minute one way ticket I was ticketed with the assurance that they will review the audio tape from my conversation when I was re-booked and issue a refund based on that... 

My post is a word of warning, if it seems too easy with an airline, it probably is... and a question:
 
Luckily, I have a business card that I used to pay for the last minute ticket as they would have had to buy me a return ticket if I wasn't already traveling. What would have happened if I was a broke backpacker? I guess I could have ran my complaint up the chain with more pressure if I didn't have the money, but it just seems wild that I have a piece of paper with a booking showing a one-way flight with status confirmed and they would have just left me stranded in a foreign country. Anyone have experience when just paying and fighting it out later wasn't an option?

I don't mind flying Westjet, but I'm not flying to Canada more than every couple of years, and frankly I'd rather have the money. Last minute plane tickets were expensive af. 

Is there an effective way to argue my case beyond, ""Look, I can't use these""?"

Flights,"Questions regarding buying a two leg trip from different airlines. So my boyfriend and I are taking my parents to Hawaii in October. Initially we were going to go out of an airport in my city with everything costing about $1300/person (it was all United Airlines). Well I got an e-mail from an airline that only goes out of a city 30 minutes away with a $126 round trip deal to Los Angeles and packages from various airlines out of LAX to be around $800-$900 per person. So my main questions are: What is a reasonable amount of time should I aim for between landing in LAX and the flight to HNL? Also, how do I make sure to get our luggage tagged to get on the next flight to HNL? Like, if I used Hawaiian airlines for the LAX-HNL part (which isn't an airline in the city near me) will my luggage get tagged for that flight or will I have to leave the terminal in LAX, get my luggage, and then recheck it? If it is overly complicated, I may just forego the savings and keep the trip as stressfree as possible. Just curious because the LAX option saves a heck of a lot of money and wouldn't mind putting it towards a room upgrade or spa day. Thanks in advance."

Flights,"Extra luggage AUS -&gt; EU Hello travellers,

long shot, but maybe someone happens to be familiar with this situation.

So I need to go back from Australia to Europe in less than two months. I've checked all those best price websites and did find a few okay prices (not expecting too much regarding the short notice booking).

Now the problem is, I've got heaps of luggage (spent a year here, and worked at a company with great staff discount, also started studying and will need those books...). Definitely more than 23kg or sth that the reasonably priced flights allow. It seems to be horribly expensive to even take one extra kilo with most airlines (not surprising though).

Would anyone happen to know an airline with reasonable luggage allowances? Or some other workaround?

Alternatively, I'm considering shipping some stuff. Apparently I could ship some 10 kilos for about AUD100. I don't care when it arrives, so that might be the best option.

Any hint would be greatly appreciated, thanks!

Edit:
So, I ended up booking a flight with China Eastern Airlines. It was a pretty good price (the cheapest for that route for that period of time I have to go), I hadn't expected to find such a good price. Also just a short layover, so a good flight duration also. And they have a baggage allowance of two bags 23kg each! That's perfect for me. I found it via a Google flights search. Thanks everyone for the advice!"

I'm looking for a specific flight alert and I'm hoping someone can suggest something for me. I'd like to be able to go to some website, make an account and set an alert so that I get an email everytime a round trip flight to anywhere in europe, for any duration of time, goes under a certain price.  

Specifically, I'd like to know anytime a round trip flight leaves New York or Philadelphia to any city in Europe for under $700.  

I've tried google flights, Expedia, etc and, while they have cool search features for specific dates or specific cities, I'm able to move my work schedule around at will and, for that reason, I want to be able to let cheap flight deals pick my travel times - not my work schedule. Since I'm not looking for a specific city at a specific set of dates, I can't use Google flights and others as efficiently as I would like to.

I want to be able to get similar tip-offs for cheap round-trip tickets without having to get lucky while looking for Christmas presents on Slickdeals.

Flights,"XL France lost my luggage So I am in quite the predicament. I was flying in from Charles Del Gaulle to LAX on XL France. They lost my luggage along with what seems like at least 20 other peoples. They claimed they probably left it all in Paris and would send it over with the next flight on Sunday. So that was a whole stressful issue. It took me an extra 2 hours to get out of the terminal because of the lost luggage line.

Anyway, here's the issue. I was traveling with a partner who had to leave immediately after getting his bag because he had another flight to catch. However, he has the stub with both of our ticket ID's on them, and the way the LAX Tom Bradly works is that there is ZERO service until you exit the whol customs/baggage area. So I had no way of getting into contact with him. So all I could give the service members was my name and what the bag looked like. They said it's probabl enough because my bag will have a tag on it. I get in my car, and I realize my bag might actually have my friend's name on it. We had been on 2 previous flights, and both times they had put his name on my bag and vice versa by accident. I didn't check this time, and he already threw away his tag from the shared flight, so there is no way to know. BUT, he did send me a photo of the bag ID stub, so I now have this.

I spent all morning calling XL France, but a message always came up (in French so I don't understand), and it would hang up without the option for a voice message. I just want to get into contact with them so I can update my claim form with the ID number and tell them it might have my friends name on it.

What are my options here? If they find my bag, but it has my friends name on it, and he didn't fill out a lost baggage claim, would they still call him and be like ""we have our bag?"" How does all this work?

At the same time, mind you, your earlier scheduled flight to Newark, NJ was scheduled for a delayed departure between the 4-5pm time slot. Then shortly afterwards, we are delayed until 634pm. Still not terrible but whatever. Now one would figure a 1 hour delay would turn into an accelerated flight to still try and get you to your destination on time but not with United. Scheduled arrival is now 1159pm!!! How does that math work??? Please explain it to me. Ok now 30 minutes later (~420pm) the flight is back on time. WIN!! Departure for 525pm arrive at 837pm. Now it's time to board. Annnndddd we're sitting on the plane for 2 hours. Great back to square 1. 

Now of course United decided to never shut the cabin doors to avoid the FAA regulations. Sneaky move. Oh and let's not forget, let's send updates that the flight is delayed and scheduled to depart 10 minutes before your planned departure. Yet again, notify us at the last minute to avoid penalties.

So now we have been sitting on the plane since 430pm and just pushed from the gate to site for another 40+ minutes because ""hey we can't go anywhere because of weather but let's keep everyone trapped like sardines and find a new parking spot""

Flights,"2 hour drive to Detroit for a nonstop flight to LAX, OR no drive for a 1 stop flight from Grand Rapids to Chicago, on to LAX? Hello all. I haven't flown in about 7 years, but one thing I would like to do is consider all of my apparent options and make the best choice with your opinions included.

I am flying to California on 7/28 and returning on 7/31 and I have been looking at round trips from GRR to LAX on google flights, and they also have a suggestion for nonstop from Detroit to LAX, which also happens to be around $100 cheaper up front. Also, no direct GRR to LAX can be found of course.

If I choose the nonstop in Detroit, I can stay with a relative the night before who lives about 30 miles from the airport and I would Uber from there and leave my car in her garage until 7/31 (she will also be out of town). The downside of this is the later return on 7/31 and having to Uber back to her place and then drive back the near 2 hours home to Grand Rapids.

[Screenshot of flight 1](http://imgur.com/5oUhUPT) - $280 or so 

My second option is to fly directly from GRR to Chicago, lay over for a couple of hours, and fly on to LAX. For this, I would be dropped off at GRR and picked up on 7/31 with no stresses from that part of the first option, and after the trip is over, I am 15 minutes from my house and not nearly 3 hours or more all told.

[Screenshot of flight 2](http://imgur.com/h67Czm0) - $365 or so 


So, I am stuck on trying to choose which one might be best. I like the convenience of the nonstop flight, but I also like the convenience of leaving directly from my home and returning there.


Any thoughts or maybe options I have not considered? I do not fly much, so I might be missing something obvious.

I was scheduled on a flight from DCA to BNA, which was quite bizarre.

First, all passengers scanned our boarding pass, and went to a shuttle that would take us to the plane. However they had us all go back inside and RE-scan our boarding passes, as the system somehow messed up.

We all got on the shuttle again, it drove to the plane, and we waited on it for over 30 minutes, before it turned around and took us back to the gate again. We were told that the flight crew and captain were not there.

We all waited at the gate for about 2 hours, while they assured us the crew was on the way, and we would board as soon as the captain arrived. Eventually, we were told the flight was cancelled.

At the desk, they said the coded reason was that it was cancelled due to weather, and therefore they could not provide us with hotel accommodation, even though nobody the first available flights were for tomorrow.

In September, I'll be spending 5 nights in Paris, 3 in Amsterdam, and then 3 in London. I live in New Orleans, and British Airways just introduced a direct flight to London. They offered a limited time promotional fare from New Orleans to London-Heathrow, and I jumped on those tickets, without really planning how I would get to Paris.
When I booked, I assumed that I would just catch a train from London-Heathrow to Paris. After some research, I have discovered that taking the Eurostar train from London to Paris actually would require me to travel from London-Heathrow into the London city center, and would likely involve more time and money than simply catching a flight from London-Heathrow to Paris.
Problem: I don't want to land at London-Heathrow, be forced to get my bags and go through customs, immigration, etc, then re-board a plane at London-Heathrow, land in Paris, then be forced to go through customs, immigration, etc all over again. It would be much easier if I could add another British Airways flight from London-Heathrow to Paris, but have it designated as a ""connecting flight"" so that I wouldn't need to go through customs, etc, in London. When I called Chase, they weren't sure how to do that. The only thing they could offer me was to book the Paris connection as a totally separate reservation (which would require me to go through customs in London) or to cancel the original reservation and book an entirely new one -- which would result in me losing my promotional fare, costing me several hundred dollars. When I called BA, they told me it was out of their control entirely and only the booking agent could make changes to my reservation.
Anyone have ideas on how to fix this issue or what my best options are? Thanks!!"

I'm in Australia for work, finished yesterday and got work to book me a return to the US on Monday. Plan was to do a quick weekend trip within Australia - fly out Friday evening and return Sunday evening in time for Monday morning flight. Our Friday evening flight was canceled due to weather, and I've been on hold with Virgin Australia customer service for 90 minutes and counting. I just got an email from Virgin rebooking me and my travel buddy on a Sunday morning flight. That makes the trip pointless from our perspective, so I want to cancel - any tips on getting the airline to refund us if we ask for this?

Also because it was weather related and we weren't in the middle of a connection, Virgin policy was to not accommodate us.  For now I'm stuck in some temporary accommodation on hold - but wondering if I should hang up and dial back later. Does it matter when I call if I need them to cancel my flight? I'm calling from Skype on a computer since I don't have a working phone in Australia.

Thanks in advance!"
Flights,3rd party booking site Sorry if this has been answered before but I couldn't find the answer when searched. If you buy one ticket on a 3rd party booking site such as kiwi or cheapoair that there is multiple airlines on will the airline honor the ticket if a leg is delayed or cancelled and you miss the second flight? such as westjet/korean air. Same when you book a multi city trip all on one ticket? thanks

Flights,One piece of Baggage allowed. What about carry on luggage? [deleted]
Flights,Layover time from international to domestic flight booked through one airline? I know this sort of question has been asked a lot but I'm having trouble getting an answer for my specific situation. I'm looking to book a flight from Dublin airport to O'Hare in Chicago and to fly from Chicago to Wichita. The international flight will be booked through Aer Lingus who offer a connecting flight with Skywest from Chicago to Wichita. I've never had a connecting flight before so I'm not sure if 1 hour and 40 minutes is enough time. It seems there is 1 outbound flight a day and each flight connects with a 1 hour 40 minute layover so I'm assuming it must be enough time if Aer Linus is who I'm booking through?

I don't want a refund, I just want to know if they'll be charging a $200 fee or just removing $200 from the refund.

Flights,"Will I have enough time to transfer from my domestic to my international flight? (Checked bags worry) I have two round trips I purchased after using Kayak's hacker fare feature, SFO-LAX (AA) and LAX-HND (JAL). The AA flight is through AA themselves, and the JAL flight was purchased through CheapOAir.

On the departure trip I arrive at LAX at 8:47am and depart for HND at 10:45am. That leaves me under two hours to switch from domestic to international since I assume I'll need to gather my checked luggage and check in again.

I've never flown with a layover so I'm not familiar with the process, so please clarify this process with me!

Another thing I'm confused about and customer service from AA and CheapOAir could not help me with: The JAL/CheapOAir itinerary mentions the flight is operated by American Airlines. I could not confirm if my flights are connected or know if there is any chance it could be. Is there any chance my checked baggage would be flown directly from SFO to HND? Of course, I'll ask the check-in desk the day of, but the trip is in about 20 days and this worries me.

Also, my AA itinerary says I'm flying Economy. Is this the same as Basic Economy? Will I even have checked baggage?

Flights,"Flights Bangkok to Dublin- are these ever likely to get cheaper than ~$850? Want to bring a bike on the return leg. I am hoping to fly from Bangkok to Dublin (and back) at some point over the next year or so, I'm reasonably flexible. The prices seem really high at the moment though, around $850+ return. I started looking at prices around a year ago and they were cheaper then, starting around $600. They went up in February 2017, according to my Google Flights alert, and have been pretty much stuck there ever since.

I've met people coming from Europe who have spent as little as 300 EUR on a return (that is a good deal, I know) so I sort of feel it should be possible to get something cheaper, but any time I look, no matter what the dates, it's around that price.

I'm flexible as to dates, I also wouldn't mind stopping somewhere interesting particularly on the way to Ireland, if that made it cheaper. I'd have a preference not to be in Ireland when it's mid-winter though guess up to end-September this year or if not possible maybe starting April or so next year?

On the way back specifically I'd like to be on an airline that lets me take a bike for free or a nominal amount as I want to bring one back from Ireland... only around 7kg of bike but they are large things that have to go through oversize baggage. Many airlines will let you just take this as part of your 20-30kg allowance and I won't have any other checked baggage, just the bike. Some will charge you like $50 which is also fine, but I'd prefer like the $0-50 end of it than paying $500 extra for the bike.

Any tips appreciated."
Flights,"Horrible Delta airlines experience Today I was on my way to Miami with some family. One leg of the trip was from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale.. naturally the flight was overbooked and they sought volunteers to give up their seats. After a short delay they had their volunteers (no dragging on this flight!) and we started boarding. 

I found out pretty quickly that our seats sucked.. last row right by the bathrooms. Not my first time sitting there so not a huge deal. Then out of the blue the vent above the aisle started leaking water...and not a drip here and there... it was a pretty considerable amount of water and it was pouring right onto aisle seat that my sister was seated in. We brought this to the attention of the flight attendants and one of them told us that it wasn't the first time that day that it happened and that the mechanics just never fix that issue... Clearly eager to get everyome seated the other flight attendant (in charge?) told us that the flight was overbooked and that if we ""didn't want to fly with them (us)"" we could get off. After some complaining said flight attendant found a crewmember catching a ride back elsewhere and profusely apologized to him (but nevee to us) before asking him to switch seats with my sister. On the way out my sister thanked the crewmember who switched seats with her. Seeing this the FA must have expected a thank you as well because when she didn't get one she blurted out ""not even a thank you?"". 

That's my story. Just wanted to share my bad experience. Bonus photo ""fix"" the delta crew implemented to help with the issue short term.. it looks funny but it was a lot more than the rude flight attendant seemed to be willing to do.

I could get the tickets I want booking via ANA's website, but not sure if I could use the MileagePlus miles to upgrade.

Does anyone know how strict Lufthansa is with their luggage allowance and whether they will even check the dimensions of my suitcase? Maybe someone has already been in a similar situation and could share their experience?

On August 26th I am flying with American Airlines from Santa Barbara, CA to Pittsburgh, PA. I was to depart at 7:30 PM (PST) and land in Pittsburgh at 9:30 AM (EST) the next day. Two transfers at Phoenix and Charlotte. Long flight but it worked for us.

I figured it wouldn't be a problem, I would just change some of the dates and pay the difference.  Well, the difference ranges from $600-$900.  Crazy.  So, I figured I would just skip some of the flights on the itinerary and then buy a new ticket (which is only $300).  

I called Air Canada, and have now been told that if I miss a single flight on my itinerary, I cannot take any of the further tickets... ie: I won't be able to board my flight back to Asia.  They are basically force feeding me the entire ticket.  It's just one leg of the journey I want to change - a domestic portion, from one city in Canada to another, but because it counts as an ""international flight"" (because Asia is on either end), they say this is not possible.  It is their policy, but is this policy legal?"

* inability to find a flight crew [American] ~ 3-4 hours

* won't put the bridge out while it's raining hard* [Delta] ~ 2 hours on the tarmac

* technical issue with wing flaps (takeoff) and inability to find a gate (deplaning) [JetBlue] ~ 5 hours on Tarmac and at the gate

Has anyone had a bad stretch like this? Is it just a variance thing or is this indicative of some kind of trend? Could it be cutbacks in staff, deteriorating equipment from insufficient maintenance, etc.?

Flights,"Changing return flight to different departure continent (Virgin Atlantic) Hi r/flights

My girlfriend an I are currently traveling through Mexico, and are hoping to extend our travels to Asia in September. To afford this, we'd need to change our return flight to Bangkok&gt;London (currently Cancun&gt;London). Virgin will allow us to change the flight so long as it still ends in London, but say we have to depart from the planned continent.

This seems strange for a global company - does anyone have experience in changing flights across continents? Any knowledge would be incredible helpful!

Thanks!"
Flights,"Two confirmation codes, one reservation – which one do I check in under (LATAM, through priceline)? I booked a roundtrip flight from Miami to Santiago on LATAM. I got a good deal, but there's a catch: I have a direct flight there (MIA-SCL), but my return goes SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA. This itinerary showed up in Google Flights and on LATAM's website, but LATAM was having issues with my card, so I ended up booking through Priceline and received 2 confirmation codes.

Searching under ""My Trips"" on LATAM's website, the first code shows the whole itinerary (MIA-SCL-ASU-GRU-MIA) but does not allow me to select seats. The second code just shows the direct MIA-SCL leg, and I was able to select a seat. I posted here a few months ago, and to my understanding this is because of the numerous companies operating under LATAM (Chile, Paraguay, Brazil, etc).

So, which code do I check in under? The one that shows the whole trip (but I couldn't select a seat for the SCL-MIA leg) or the one that just shows SCL-MIA where I already have selected a seat?"

Can anyone give me justification for why a one way ticket from DEN to ICT is the same (or close to) price as a round trip? Or why a round trip ticket is usually less expensive from ICT to LAX with a layover in DEN than a round trip ICT to DEN? Note that when looking the prices up I use the same dates/times for flights, so that’s not the reason.

Maybe this will work for you in the future, maybe not. I had a $200 voucher with frontier. on the 11th (5 days ago), I tried to use it to book a flight, but my card was declined so I just left it alone to wait until payday. 

Payday's today, so I hop online to book it again. Much to my chagrin, the voucher was no longer working. So I called frontier to inquire as to why and they said the voucher was burned when I tried to use it on the 11th. They can issue a new one OR they can try to run the payment again. Well in the meantime the price of the flight had gone up another $200, so I opted to just try to runt he payment again and it went through. Not only did the voucher still work but it saved me the $200 that the flight went up in the meantime. It is probably a bad idea to bank on this working in the future, but if you're in a bind it might be worth giving it a shot. Goodluck!"

I was originally scheduled to leave JFK at 2225 on Sunday, 11JUN. Flight got delayed with an updated notification time of 0300 on Monday, 12JUN. At 0300, I received a text from Norwegian airlines telling me that my new flight would be at 2225, this evening 12JUN. 

Just received another text saying we're now not leaving until tomorrow 13JUN at 1130 in the morning - getting into Paris at 0100 Wednesday morning - a full 38 hours later than originally scheduled. Furthermore, this flight isn't even going to be operated by Norwegian airlines, but rather Wamos Air - never heard of it. 

When I've asked what the issue is with the plane all the airlines reps have been able to tell me is that the original plane was late and had to land in Ireland. They won't give any more information with regards to the cause of the problem. I've also asked them to rebook me on other flights, but they said they cannot do to that. They were even also unwilling to rebook me on a Norwegian airlines flight to London that had space available. 

They've basically rebuffed every attempt I've made to find a workable solution - all they have offered is just sit tight and wait or cancel my flight entirely, book with another airline and try to get compensated after the fact with no guarantees. I was unwilling to do that because they won't even give me the reason for the original flight being late. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, they said their supervisors do not take calls - only e-mails. Overall, the personnel on the phone were nice, but their hands are completely tied - what's the point of having a line to call if you don't empower the people on the phone to actually do anything. 

For now, I'm just planning on leaving tomorrow, but who knows if the flight will even go. This seems ripe for compensation according to http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/holidays/article-2271213/How-claim-EU-flight-delay-compensation-EC-261-2004.html

One of the passengers ended up w/ first and middle name swapped. Pure clerical error. (This person goes by middle name usually, so just had a spacey moment I guess.)

Anyways, it was unfortunately through Expedia and now they and Turkish Airlines are basically just pointing fingers at each other saying that the other one has to do the name change. Expedia says that they are ""limited"" by Turkish's policy and can't do it, Turkish tells me to go talk to Expedia.

So at this point it seems like a lost ticket, except, that just seems absolutely crazy. At the moment, we're considering a notarized affidavit of ""One and the Same Person,"" or some such to bring along with passports and whatever else.

Flights,"Connecting flight on a tight schedule, baggage question Hi guys, airport newbie here with a weirdish question. I have a flight that goes from SYD-&gt;LAX with a 3h 30 min layover in LAX. Then LAX-&gt;ATL with a 1h 2 min layover in Atlanta. And then finally ATL-&gt;GDL.


I am almost certain that I will need to go through customs and claim my baggage in LAX since my connecting flight is domestic. However, I am uncertain if I'll need to claim my baggage again in Atlanta, or if that's going to be managed by the airline.


I am concerned because 1hr 2 min doesn't seem enough time to claim the baggage, re-sumbit them and find my gate. Thanks for your help!"

Flights,"Does my long haul multicity itinerary to Asia make sense? Or am I crazy? Okay sooo. I'm from LAS (Vegas) and want to visit KUL (Malaysia) in mid-December 2017 solo, and return early Jan 2018 with my mom. She'll then return to KUL solo sometime in March 2018.

1. I get extremely nervous on flights so I kind of want to splurge on a premium economy on my solo trip to KUL. 
2. I don't mind a long layover, in fact I prefer it so I can de-compress in a hotel or something.
3. My mom wants to visit my brother in HKG on our way back, and wants to stay a couple days before continuing on to LAS.
4. She will be making a solo trip back to KUL.

Sooo... here is my craaazy idea:
1. LAS &gt; SFO &gt; NRT &gt; KUL I'm thinking I could multicity this on ANA or JAL and stay in Japan for a couple days before continuing to KUL? I found one way premium economy on JAL/ANA for $1400ish, EXPENSIVE I KNOW but I think it's worth it if I can squeeze in a mini Tokyo vacation?

2. KUL &gt; HKG &gt; LAX &gt; LAS I'll book two of these as economy on Cathay using multicity, and try to find a 2 day layover in HKG before continuing back to LAS. Feasible?

3. LAX &gt; HKG &gt; KUL Mom's flight back to KUL would also be bought separately.

So this insane itinerary means everything would be one way and multicity, which I know is more expensive than buying round trips. My friends told me to just buy two HKG round trips for me and mom and just make sure we're on the same flight back to LAS, but I don't know how I can do that and still make sure we sit next to each other (very important)? If that is possible and significantly cheaper, I'll forgo Japan and would rather just layover in HKG both ways.

While I have done long haul trips before, I have never bought them myself nor faced such complications. I've been using Google Flights so far. Please advise me!"
Flights,"Alaska / Virgin changed one reserved seat Normally, I do not mind changes on any flights I take but with my first family flight flying from New Jersey to San Francisco I am a bit upset to find out that our reserved seats were changed. I had booked 1 seat with my 6 month old and 2 seats for my wife and 2 year old right next to us. This was on the same row for both departing and returning. I received e-mail confirmations from Alaska Airlines confirming this so figured things were good to go.  

Now we fly out on June 10th and I look at my Virgin Mobile app (I booked through Alaska but it is a Virgin America flight) and it shows I have been bumped from row 4 to row 22. But only my seat was bumped and my wife and 2 year old are still in row 4. I contacted Alaska and Virgin and they informed me that since I have an infant in my lap that the airport had bumped me and there is nothing they can do.

They advised that when I get to the airport to talk to them to get moved into the same row. Is this a common occurrance when traveling with a 6 month old? It seemed very bizarre for this to occur.

Is this something I shouldn't panic about and be confident that this will be corrected upon arrival?"

Flights,"Iceland air catastrophic incompetence, recourse? So I chose to fly icelandair on the way home from our europe trip and take advantahe of that overnight thing, to see the blue lagoon. We were supposed to arrive at 4:00 pm. I paid extra for this, and added a few hours to my flight home. Could have been in boston most of the way home.



Here is the list of absurd things that culminated in the worst air line experience I've ever had.

1. Took an extra hour to take off due to  them failing to finish preparing the toilets. Of course they did the any minute we will be ready, (which is why my phone was in airplane mode at the 1:30 boarding time.)

2. Land at 5 instead of 4, then sit for 10-15 minutes watching them try to line up the ramp with the plane. Must have been a first timer.

3. We were told our.bags would be available for overnight by the stewardess. After which we discovered they wouldn't be available, then we discovered they actually, by mistake, put our bags on the wrong turn style. Had we not seen them, who knows where they would have gone. Took about an hour to fix that.

4. At this point, 6 ish,  we turn our phones back on, and discover  that our flight, at around 2ish, we had been changed from 10:30 am tomorrow to 5:40 pm today (not by this time, it's 6. So we already missed it).  I tried to find help and no one was available at the departure, there was another guy also who had missed a connection trying to find help and couldn't find anyone either. Their machine was down or something.

5. Iceland Air was totally unsympathetic and rude.



Of course the end of the story Is I spent 2 hours on the phone trying to get our plane fixed, still have no idea where our luggage is, and no blue lagoon, and instead of going out to dinner my wife had to go grab some junky Thai food while I was on the phone before things closed. I came all the way to iceland to see the inside of a hotel room. It's really sad.

I dont expect to really be compensated, but I don't like them being able to just do that without having to own up to it. Thoughts?

I live near an international airport, but he lives in the middle of BFE and has to catch a regional jet to get to a major airport. Multi city booking starts getting weird when you say you want to fly out of a specific airport together and they insist this airport other is just as good but adds a layover in South Korea which is what we want to avoid.

When I came to Europe from the US, I flew with Condor in Economy Premium first (US--&gt; Germany), and then with Lufthansa in Economy class (Germany --&gt; final destination).

Couldn't find this by googling or searching the site. It's not a flight price issue as such but rather is a mismatch of actual flights between Kayak and the AA site. 

&amp;nbsp;

I am booking a multi-stop return flight and was checking prices via Kayak. I got what seems to be a great deal on Kayak with AA and it says the provider is American Airlines, not multiple airlines or a third party site etc. I can click the deal to take me to the AA site and I can proceed all the way to the final payment.

&amp;nbsp;

I just decided to double check on the AA site properly and I can't find the return flight option at all. I can match the Kayak flight out with the airline's site (not sure if price is the same for that leg), but the Kayak departure and subsequent stops are not available on the AA site.

&amp;nbsp;

I think I might take the chance and book it because it's all via the AA site, but I'm slightly concerned that if I book it and they claim that it isn't valid that I'll end up in a protracted argument to get my money back. Also I'm not based in the States so that might complicate things further.

It's also the same on the return flight. 
This is all under one booking as I'm not booking the flights separately. It just uses multiple airlines to get to my destination. Will this cause any problems (for example, if my first flight got delayed)? Will I have to pick up my luggage at the connecting airport or will it transfer automatically because its all under one booking?

Flights,"Just tried Norwegian Airline Hi guys,

So, me and my girlfriend just tried Norwegian Airline for the first time. I was skeptical at first, but I've to say I'm very pleased with the quality of the company.

We bought two tickets for going back home (Malaga - London), paying £27 per ticket. The cheapest fare we could find. The aircraft was brand new, you've entertainment on board and - most of all - free wifi.

I fly a lot with various companies (Ryanair, EasyJet, Alitalia, British Airways, Meridiana, Vueling) and this is the first time I've flew with wifi on board. I didn't even know you could get wifi for a relatively short flight (3h) like this one.

We even carried a trolley, backpack and another small bag each and they let us go without saying anything. 

The only thing is that you'll have to pay for drink/food, but this is almost true for basically every low-cost airline.

Just wanted to share my opinion. Anyone else tried Norwegian?

Thank you!"

I booked with the airline (Pegasus Airlines, a Turkish carrier I've never had any problems with in the past) and not with any sort of travel agency. The day prior, I checked in online and everything was okay.

I get to the airport and I'm informed my ticket has been cancelled. They can't tell me why, because their system is down. They also can't book me a new ticket. I had booked my ticket in two parts, and I needed to get to my next destination (Stockholm), to make my final flight. I eventually had to book a new ticket online with another airline for the same day, for 5 times the original price. 

I was able to talk to a Pegasus representative, and they told me that they cancelled my ticket for 'suspicious activity' but wouldn't elaborate. They also made no attempt to notify me prior. They said they'll refund my original ticket, but won't reimburse me for the much, much pricier day-of ticket. 

Do I have any options? Is there anything I can do? Pegasus doesn't even have any sort of complaint form, only a customer hotline which has been very unhelpful.

Bored on my grueling 10-hour flight home from Beijing yesterday, I pulled out my iPhone to scroll through photos to kill time. Almost immediately, a flight attendant comes by and orders me to turn off my phone. I quietly obliged as I knew of this Civil Aviation Administration of China regulation (embarrassingly, I had previously gotten into a ""debate"" with a flight attendant over this very issue a couple years ago). I also know better than to question and disobey Chinese law. 

But it got me to wondering why prohibit mobile phones on airplane mode but not tablets or laptops? Other than *""because China""*. I did a Google search but could not find any definitive answers. What do you guys think?

Some possible explanations:

* Censorship for Chinese citizens? But wouldn't they just go abroad and Google all the stuff they want to?

* The Chinese authority doesn't trust that people are smart enough to turn airplane mode on?

* It is possible for some mobile phones to still make emergency calls despite being on airplane mode? "
Flights,"I have a quick question about flying internationally into DTW from Incheon I have a one way ticket from Bangkok to Toronto. The flight goes from Bangkok to Incheon, layover for 16 hours, then Incheon to Detroit, layover for three hours, and then Toronto.

My hometown is 15 minutes away from Detroit, so I would prefer to get off there and abandon the rest of my flight itinerary. 

What I would like to know is if I need to recheck my checked luggage bags after going through US customs. I had emailed Delta, but they are pretty slow to respond and they said ""Generally, baggage may be checked to the final destination on the passenger's ticket up to 6 hours before departure. Checked baggage cannot be retrieved en-route or at connecting cities.

If you are returning from an international itinerary, you will clear
U.S. Customs at the first point of entry into the United States.""

But seeing as I'm flying in from Asia, I figured that my baggage would be pulled from inspection. I've only ever flown out of the US to Asia, but not back in. Do they do U.S. Customs checks at Incheon airport?

Flights,"[x-post from /r/travel]: WOW air business vs. Norwegian air? Which would you choose? Forgive me if I'm violating any rules. I looked at the sidebar and searched so hopefully I'm not.

I basically just want some advice on which flight you all think would be a better experience. My husband and I are flying to Amsterdam on July 30 from LAX. One way tickets are $300 for WOW economy, $600 for WOW business, and ~$600 for Norwegian economy. I've heard horror stories about WOW air, so we were thinking of just sucking it up and paying for Norwegian--however, the new business class seats on WOW are the same price. Problem is, there are no reviews out on them yet because the seats aren't available until June 1.

I guess I'm just asking: what would you do? If you've flown with WOW air, how was it? Is the service horrible? The legroom non-existent? The flight late? If you've flown Norwegian as well, how do they compare?

Again, I hope I'm not breaking any rules with this post. Thanks in advance!

Flights,"Seoul - Milan one way trip with considerable luggage Hello.

A friend of mine is currently in Seoul and will be coming back to Italy in early September. Her Visa expires on the 7th and she'd like to be there until the last day, but it's possible she'll have to come back earlier due to external reasons.

Priorities include price, safety, flight time and, as per the title, the possibility to carry a non trivial amount of luggage.

As far as the cost goes, the lowest is obviously the better, with 1000€ being completely unacceptable. Something along the lines of 500€ would be excellent. Therefore, a 600€ budget seems reasonable. This should include additional fares from the extra baggage.

Safety is a concern, but outside of really sketchy options I reckon it has diminishing returns. We're not talking Raymond (Rain Man) levels of insecurity: any reputable company is alright.

Quickness is another factor that only becomes relevant over a certain threshold. 13h flights are definitely not worth the cost and 31h ones are way too lenghty. 16-18h seems like a sensible range.

All of these I could probably figure out by myself, altough hearing a second opinion would still help, but the baggage is where I'd really like some help, since the alternative is consulting with each airline.

For the outbound flight, she barely managed with the 31 Kg allowed by Emirates. On the way back, she's going to need more. Ideally another 30 Kg, but 25 or even 20 might suffice.

According to her sister in law, who allegedly did so several times, it's possible to get such an extension by explaining one's status as a student residing abroad for several months. Unfortunately, Emirates didn't seem to provide that option, when she inquired in February.

Thanks in advance."
Flights,"Are Airlines supposed to use another airline to expedite lost (""delayed"") bags? On May 20 my bag was supposed to arrive with me from LAX to ZIH on Delta flight DL645, but it never did.

Well, now I have no idea if the bag actually arrived on the Aeromexico flight because airlines only have agents at ZIH if there is a flight within a small time frame.

I called Delta Baggage in Atlanta and they can't see updates to my bag anymore because they handed my bag off to Aeromexico. Like what the hell, man?

Flights,"Lost Baggage. Delta/WestJet Hi,

Yesterday (May 19) I flew on a Delta flight that was operated by WestJet. I checked my bag with WestJet and that they are who printed the baggage sticker. It's a WestJet number. The flight was WS 1100 from Toronto to Los Angeles. The flight was meant to be a layover, and then today I flew from LAX to Ixapta/Zihuantenjo (Mexico) on a Delta operated flight DL 645.

When I arrived in LAX yesterday, my bag never came out of the turnstile. Toronto was the last I saw it. I notified both WestJet and Delta (who are right beside each other at LAX) but neither cared and didn't ultimately know who was responsible for it, and how to proceed, or how the bag even goes from Toronto ultimately to Mexico. Yesterday, one lady at Delta baggage services (LAX) told me my bag would ultimately end up in Mexico today , since the flight to LAX was a layover. Still she couldn't actually verify this. That was really the only attempt at an answer I got.

Well today came and when I got off the DL 645 there was no bag here in Mexico.

My question is how do I proceed with this? Neither Delta or WestJet knows how to track it. I don't even know if it made it from Toronto to Los Angeles on WS 1100, let alone from LA to Mexico today.

Please. Anything would help.

Flights,"Need help with choosing a flight into Buffalo NY from Incheon Hello! I'll be flying into Buffalo NY from Incheon this August and have to choose between Korean Air or Asiana Airlines (their flight timings and prices are the best so far).


If i were to take Korean Air, i'd be able to book the entire journey from Incheon to Buffalo under KAL, whereas if i were to take Asiana Airlines, i'd have to book a separate domestic flight (JFK to BUF) under Delta.


My flight route for Korean Air would be Incheon =&gt; Atlanta-Hartsfield Jackson (ATL) =&gt; Buffalo, while the Asiana-Delta route will be Incheon =&gt; JFK =&gt; Buffalo.


I'm leaning more towards Asiana Airlines and Delta because it's cheaper overall and i get to try first class (even though it's on a domestic flight lol) for the first time ever.


The only thing i'm worried about now is whether i'd have a problem moving around JFK because i've heard that check-ins and clearing immigration/customs there take forever, especially since i'm an international student travelling on a visa. It's also my first time into the States so i have no idea how the airports there are like.


I'd have slightly over 4 hours layover in JFK, and my main concern is that 4 hours might be a little tight since i'd have to check-out and check-in again if i take Asiana-Delta. On the other hand, i have a 3 hour layover in ATL if i choose Korean Air. I'm also assuming i do not have to check-out and check-in when i'm in ATL since my flights are all operated by Korean Air (even though the ATL-BUF leg is gonna be on a Delta plane).

Has anyone had experience having to check-out and check-in at JFK from an international flight to a domestic one and how was it? Or would it be better if i just booked Korean Air since all the flights from Incheon to Buffalo will be operated under one airline?


Thanks in advance for reading and taking the time to respond! I appreciate any advice :)

Then, I've been waiting his call for days after I arrived my destination, but didn't receive any call back from Flightnetwork.
So, I called them again with another agent to make sure whether i can get a refund or not. She confirmed that I can get a refund, and said she will send email. So, I waited few more days.
still didn't get a reply from them, so I called them again today twice.(because one of them just hung up right after saying it's non-refundable. Even when I was speaking)
Both said it's non-refundable because I used part of the flight.
So, I asked for the extension number for two prior agents, but they refused.

2. The agent I spoke with today said to ask for a refund from the airlines. But the airlines say to get a refund from the place where I booked my flight.(which is flightnetwork)

Flights,"Frontier airlines. Never never again... Proper protocol for bodily fluids and contamination during flight? TLDR- Projectile vomitter and surrounding passengers left to fend for ourselves on frontier flight due to poor (absent?) handling of the situation by flight crew. 

Took a red eye Frontier flight to Orlando from San Diego. 

Other than just being an arduously long flight... the person sitting DIRECTLY behind me was projectile vomiting everywhere! Instead of jumping right into action the flight crew was absent and sat from a distance peering in disgust! 

The poor guy was hopelessly trying to wipe it up himself with beverage napkins ppl had in their purses... I was asleep and woke when my boyfriend jumped immediately out of his chair to run down the aisle to the other side of the plane with vomit on his sleeve that had shot between the chairs and landed on him. I thankfully got nothing on me but the entire back of my chair and floor was COVERED. 

The smell was permeating the air and marinating into everyone's clothes and belongings-- that smell is etched into my mind... ever since the flight I keep reliving the horrible scent with random illusions of the odor everywhere!  Looking back on it it's actually rather funny. [Reminds me of this relevant clip](https://youtu.be/_SKdN1xQBjk)

Meanwhile I can see the flight attendants perched at their seats. The seatbelt light was NOT on when this all started. Is this normal protocol? Are airline crews not trained with how to deal with bodily fluids?? This seems dangerous to me?! Not to mention the BIOHAZARD this presented to everyone on the plane!-- what if it was infectious with something dangerous?? We have no idea where he is flying from... it was an international airport. 

People all around me are gagging from the smell and some moved around. I also had to move-- even though I felt badly bc I was sitting in a higher priced seat and the attendants had made an announcement instructing us NOT to move seats due to weight distribution in the cabin. There was no way I could stay in the vomit soaked chair. 

All this happened about 45 min before we landed. Just a layer of vomit covering a row of chairs in the middle of the plane- no towels/sweeping/deodorizer. Just us and the vomit 🤢 in recycled air. 

THEN once we got to the gate we had to sit in the runway for an additional 30 minutes --stewing in the vomit air-- because our gate WASNT READY! 

This can't possibly be standard protocol?? Surely this was negligent or against some type of safety standard/airline regulation?? 

I know Frontier has a terrible reputation for their sneaky fees but I dont even mind that. THIS, however, is a reflection of the way the airline operates, the standards they hold themselves accountable to, and the manner which we are regarded as passengers on their flights.

Flights,"Dishonest Avianca: any recourse to recover a change fee? In January, I booked an international flight on Avianca for August. In February, I realized that I needed to change to an earlier return date and bit the bullet and paid a $210 change fee to switch the return flight to my desired date.

However, I received notification today that the return trip I had changed to would be cancelled and I only had the option to rebook an itinerary a day earlier or a day later. One doesn't get me home soon enough and another doesn't allow the maximum time to enjoy my destination.

It seems like I can at least get credit for the ticket itself... and I may use that to book on another airline to return on my desired date.

However, do I have any mode of recourse to recover the change fee I paid? It seems rather scummy of them to charge me that much to change to a flight that would ultimately be cancelled. I spoke to their customer service department but they were not helpful and refused. There was also definitely a language barrier.

Change fees in general (especially if not close-in) seem to me like a terrible practice, but especially if I ultimately don't get the product I paid to change to.

Flights,"Anybody flown with Thomas Cook? What do you wish you'd known beforehand? I'm saving £200 flying from the UK to the US in a few weeks with Thomas Cook. Their budget ticket means not getting a few of the usual flight niceties (like reserved seating, free drinks/snacks, unlimited in-flight entertainment etc), but the ticket still included things like hold luggage and a meal, so it wasn't one of these SUPER budget flights.

I'm just wondering what anyone who's flown with them wished they knew beforehand. For example, I'm planning on buying a huge haul of soft drinks and snacks from duty free before boarding, as even duty free prices should still beat in-flight prices. Do they still give you stuff like cups, ice, water etc? What about a pillow/blanket/sleep mask/earplugs? Will I have to bring my own? 

Also, what are the video screens like? I was planning on bringing an iPad anyway so as not to have to pay for movies (and also the seat-back screens usually suck in clarity/brightness) but do they at least have a USB port (or even a power socket) for me to plug in/charge? 

Finally, I reserved a window seat for my return flight (so I could sleep) but this cost me £20 so I didn't bother reserving a seat for the outward (which is a daytime flight so I'll likely just be watching movies, not caring about where I sit). Do you still get to pick a seat when you check in without paying? Or, even better, with online check-in if I do it as soon as it rolls over to the 24 hour prior to departure?"

I've been flying the London (LHR) - Hong Kong, Hong Kong - London (LHR) round trip about 3 times per year, for years, and I've always flown Cathay Pacific. I'm a gold marco polo member now.

Flights,"Any travel-protection insurance that allows for cancellation for ANY reason (not just covered ones)? The travel-protection insurance that's offered on the checkout pages of online search engines and airline sites usually only covers the standard reasons: e.g. medical emergency, natural disasters, etc. Is there any insurance sold (at a higher price, I'm sure) that will allow cancellation for ANY reason, even if I just change my mind?
There are, of course, refundable fares, but I find those are usually priced significantly higher (e.g. sometimes 50% or more) just for the privilege of being able to cancel at your discretion (and other misc benefits like free bags or w/e)...was hoping there was an insurance-policy route to get the free-cancellation-for-any-reason more cost-effectively than paying that refundable-fare markup."
Flights,"North American r/t fare is usually 2 x one-way fare, but not that way for Int'l. Any hacks here? Prices in North America are at a point where there's usually no advantage to booking round-trip flights, since it's usually almost exactly (or within $10) of simply buying the 2 one-way legs separately. But I notice that's nowhere close to true yet for International flights. E.g. NYC &gt; TYO &gt; NYC nonstop is a reasonable  $1,100 r/t, but one-way on the same flights they're NYC &gt; TYO ($1,500) and TYO &gt; NYC ($1,300) for a $2,800 price that's 2.5x higher than the r/t fare.

**What I'm trying to do is fly nonstop from Toronto (YYZ) to Tokyo (5/26), and then return nonstop from Tokyo to NYC (6/4).** From my research:
- YYZ &gt; TYO &gt; YYZ is $940 r/t, and
- NYC &gt; TYO &gt; NYC is $1,100 r/t.

It would stand to reason that YYZ &gt; TYO &gt; NYC *should* be in the $1,000 vicinity...but all search engines seem to treat that as a simple multi-leg itinerary for around $3,000. And, as mentioned above, I can't just book the two one-way legs separately b/c they're priced absurdly high.

Is there any known hack for this? (i.e. departing from and returning to 2 dif airports -- in the same general vicinity -- while getting a ""roundtrip-ish"" airfare, instead of just two one-way fares that are really high?"

I am an American living in England. As my current passport is nearly 3 years old I have no more pages left for stamps. Although I have been assured I won't have an issue returning to the US, I will have to get a new passport while I am in the US.

This means I will have to fly my return flight to the UK on a different passport (with obviously a different number). Is this doable?

Thanks"

Flights,"Accidentally booked for First Class, or a generous upgrade? Hi all. I hope this question doesn't break the rules, couldn't find anything similar to it.
My partner and I are flying overseas because she needs a medical procedure. We booked direct returns through a discount agency (STA Travel), requesting Economy. 
I did tell them that my partner will need a wheelchair at the airport on the flight back, and her surgeon will provide a letter too that will urge the airline to give her seat with more legroom at check-in. They confirmed this is possible, but ""to be 100% sure Premium Economy booking is recommended"". It was beyond our budget so we said no thanks.

We paid for the Economy direct returns, and we got our itinerary in the inbox. I just noticed that it it says Economy outbound, but First Class for inbound?

I'm guessing it's an accident, but what if I inquire and they put us back in Economy (ha...)? If I keep quiet, will we just be able to board First Class while paying Economy price?
Or did they give us an upgrade, given that my partner will be post-surgery?"

Flights,"Is There Some Type of Program for Companies Who Regularly Book Flights for Their Employees? Hi, I'm not sure where exactly I should post this, but I'm going to explain my dilemma and see if any of you could point me in the right direction.

I recently started at a small staffing company that deals with sending candidates to different locations across the US. One job location in particular has been giving us issues, because it is all the way across the country. Our candidates have to either drive the distance, or fly. 

Part of my job is booking hotels and flights for our candidates. We book flights and hotels for the first week while they start working, and they pay us back as they work and get paid for their work. This is a very recent thing we've started doing, and we don't really know much about how to efficiently book these flights. I've run into a huge issue that has ended up costing our company money.

Say I book a flight for John Doe to go to this job location 2 days from now. If John decides he doesn't want to go anymore, or something comes up, we can't get a refund for this ticket we bought him. Best case scenario, we can receive a credit only usable by John Doe, so we can rebook a flight for him if he decides to go in the future. Otherwise, we can't use the money. It's also bad because we have to keep relying on these flaky people instead of focusing our attention on more reliable candidates, simply because we'll lose money if we don't get John Doe working so he can pay us back.

So, is there any type of company program with these airlines, where we can pay some type of fee and have protection against people who just don't show up or cancel last minute?"

Flights,"Refund of original ticket when purchasing a ticket for a different date Apologies if this has been asked before (probably) but it wasn't addressed in the faq and searching didn't turn anything up.

I booked a one-way flight from NRT to CTU via expedia.co.jp with Sichuan Airlines, a separate one-way flight from CTU to BKK a few days later via Sichuan's website, and a one-way flight from BKK to OTP a few days after arriving in Bangkok through a different, unrelated carrier.

I missed my first flight from NRT to CTU. I've emailed both expedia.co.jp customer support and Sichuan customer support trying to get my flight moved to the next NRT-CTU flight, which leaves tomorrow evening, but they have yet to respond.
 
[non-essential details: The phone support for both companies are closed or automated respectively so I'm not able to speak with a real person without doing a 40 USD roundtrip out to NRT (and they'll probably tell me what they told me last night, to contact my travel agency, i.e., expedia.co.jp.)]

Because of the urgency of catching my flight to Bucharest (my Chengdu segment essentially screwed), I was considering buying either a direct flight to Bangkok, or buying the ticket for the flight I want Sichuan to move me to. I would then try to recoup my losses later.

I paid appx. 150 USD each for NRT-CTU and CTU-BKK. The tickets I am considering (NRT-BKK or NRT-CTU tomorrow evening) are each appx 350 USD.

So when I returned home I submitted my receipts to Condor, after about 3 weeks of waiting I received a letter and check from them. Unfortunately the check only covered ~50% of my expenses, in the letter they justified this  as ""taking into consideration your ability to use these items in the future"". I don't particularly need anymore clothes, but I do need the money I spent on them. I sent them a long angry email explaining this, and have yet to receive a response. I've tried tweeting at them and calling them as well, but I've had little luck. Anyone have any similar experiences fighting airlines over reimbursement?

Flights,"How can I fly to the US from Qatar avoiding the laptop ban? Hey Reddit! This is actually my first post here. On the summer, I'll be flying from Qatar to Washington DC. I have read that laptops and such other devices excluding mobile phones are banned from the hand luggage on flights originating from the Middle East including Qatar. I am not sure whether this only applies to the Middle Eastern airlines or American ones as well, but the latter does not fly to Qatar or UAE anyway AFAIK. 
However, I might not have a checked luggage, meaning I will not have any other place to put my laptop. But even if I did have a checked luggage, I wouldn't trust putting my laptop in the checked luggage because of the potential mishandling and damages just in case. 
So is there a way to avoid the ban? 
PS.: It'd be fine if I would need to fly to another country as means of transfer flights, as long as layover is relatively short (~1-2h). 

TL;DR: I need to find a way to fly to the US from Qatar with a laptop but without a checked luggage.

Flights,"Super confused about Korean Air Payment approval form and Code Sharing with American Airlines Hello all. This is my first time traveling abroad and my first time traveling alone so I have a lot of questions and I'm confused. 


So I am flying from SAT to ICN with a connection in DFW, and then ICN to SAT with a DFW connection. 


SAT To DFW is AA, DFW to ICN in Korean Air, and both flights back are AA. Those AA flights were only available on Korean Air for some reason so I booked with them. So AA codeshares with Korean Air since Korean Air doesn't have an office in SAT. 


When you book with Korean Air, you have to confirm your payment either the day of your flight or before by bringing the debit/credit card you used to pay the for tickets at the check-in counter, or else they will refund the tickets. 


The thing is, I know I have to check in with AA for my trip from SAT-DFW-ICN, so at what point would I have to show my payment information? Would I show the American Airlines people, or would I be forced to go to DFW and fill out the payment pre-approval form before the day of the flight? OR, would I fly with AA to DFW, and then go to the Korean Air office between flights? 


Also, if I wanted to check in online, how would that would Payment pre approval form wise??

Flights,"Some questions with Korean Air So, I (finally) booked my first international flight all by myself (I actually went once abroad already but it was all booked by my high school back then) with Korean Air, since it was the only one at a reasonable price and with the exact times of arrival and departure I wanted. In a few words, perfectly timed for me. The dates are from the 10th of August from Rome to Manila and then the 20th of August from Manila to Rome.  
I have, though, a couple of questions:  

1) During my payment, there were two options after selecting to pay with my Visa. One was ""Verified by Visa"" and another one was ""Address Verification"" (if I remember correctly). Since I didn't know if I had this ""Verified by Visa"" on my card, I proceeded with ""Address Verification"". Now, at the end of the ticket, there is a ""Credit/Debit Card Verification Form"" that says this:  

**Information on Credit/Debit Card Verification Procedure**  

* If you use a credit/debit card to purchase a ticket without verifying that you are the actual cardholder, please note that we will require the cardholder to complete a card verification procedure.  
* The cardholder will be required to present the original credit/debit card used for purchase, along with valid photo identification, as well as sign the ‘Credit/Debit Card Verification Form’ at the time of check-in.  
* If the cardholder will be unavailable at the time of check-in, the cardholder needs to visit a Korean Air branch office, or airport ticket office before the departure date to verify the card.  
* If the card is unverifiable by us, we will need to fully refund the ticket purchased (any cancellation penalty will be waived) and a new ticket will need to be bought.  

Does this mean that I have to go first to a Korean Air branch office to complete the form and show them that I am the cardholder? Or I do that when I do my check-in before boarding?  
Then there is this part that is all already complete except for the ""Flight number and portion"". What should I write there? The flight number of only the first leg or all four of them?  
Passenger Name:  
Flight number and portion:  
Ticket Number:  
Credit/Debit Card Number:  

And then it asks for the date and ""Cardholder's Name and Signature"". Should I write my full name and then the signature? Or just the signature? This may be stupid but it's really bothering me so much...

2) When I arrive in Seoul, I'll be there for around 16 hours until my next flight. Will I have to go through the immigration process just because the distance between the two flights is long? Or will I be redirected by some people to a kind of waiting room?  
Korean Air website says this about the baggage:  
**From one international flight to another**  
(Example: Incheon to Tokyo to Los Angeles)  

* When you fly on a Korean Air international flight, then transfer to another international flight on a different airline to reach your final destination, your baggage is usually transferred automatically to your next flight regardless of carrier.  
* You need only check your baggage at your original departing airport and simply claim it when you arrive at your final destination.  
Does this work even if I'll be there for a long time before the next flight? Or I have to take my baggage on arrival at Seoul and re-do my check-in again when I have to go to Manila?

3) I've already searched about the visa process and for less than 90 days it's free for tourists. So, if I wanted to go out of the airport and visit some places, will this affect my next flight? If yes, how?  

4) Another small (and unrelated) thing is a difference between my ticket and SeatGuru. On my ticket, it says that the aircraft type is a Boeing 747-8I for when I go from FCO to ICN. Same thing for when I go back from ICN to FCO. I put the flight number on SeatGuru but it says that it's a Boeing 777-300ER (on the ticket it's only for ICN-MNL and vice versa but without the final ER). Is it because SeatGuru isn't updated?  

**EDIT**: This is my itinerary FCO -&gt; MNL:  
FCO -&gt; ICN  
Departure: 21:15 (10th AUG)  
Arrival: 15:40 (11th AUG)  
ICN -&gt; MNL  
Departure: 08:00 (12th AUG)  
Arrival: 10:50 (12th AUG)  
This is my itinerary MNL -&gt; FCO:

Flights,"Horrible Delta experience, seeking advice for customer service We purchased two tickets to Detroit last minute for a friend's funeral. The tickets were for Friday morning. Our flight was cancelled and the earliest they were offering flights was Monday morning. We switched and entered the standby queue for the next two days. We were also told that because it was weather related they would not put us up in a hotel for those three nights... we told them we don't have any place to go and they would not budge on that.

This morning at 6 we were at #1 and #2 in the line. Turns out that they ended up overselling every single flight from now until Monday by 15-25 seats, so standby was not happening for us. 

I don't fly often but this is utterly fucked up. Missing the memorial but going to be in Detroit for three days to see some friends which I guess is better than nothing. I feel as though we should get at least a partial refund because that Monday flight was so much cheaper than the one we bought for Friday. Any advice?"

The best I have found so far is through China airlines around $650. Second best would be Catahay Pacific at $720. 
I am certain I can cut cost further with the last minute deals but right now it does not cover the dates. Here is the reference

Flights,Price changed for checking in on the day Basically we got mugged off by Ryan Air. Arrived 2 hours before the flight to check but got held up by the queue which then meant we had to queue at the customer service desk. Once we reach there to pay; the first 2 paid £45 but then they apparently learned of a price rise and charged the next two £50. I had a text from the day before saying we could be charge £45/45 euros if we don't check-in online. Do you think I have any recourse due to them not notifying me of the price change? I complained and basically got a message saying sorry in really broken English then a clear copy paste response.

EWR is the best one for me to fly out of but I can do JFK if the flight is significantly better. I don't really think I should have to pay like $200 less than it would cost me to fly to Sydney, Australia and back RT.... I'll pay $500ish if I have to, but some of these fares are too high... and I don't really want to do this WoW airline because of the extra baggage fees and such which is the cheapest at the moment in this time frame.
The Icelandair sale was $381 round-trip. The sale had been going on since like March 1st and I found out about it mid-month so I figure oh the entire month is basically open.. I have a day or two... and nope.. because it was ALL GONE then. Ridiculous. Are other airlines going to have sales like this? What are the chances of the price going down and when?

If my flight between points A to B is delayed, and that made me miss my separately booked flight to point C, would trip delay/cancellation insurance cover a rebooking and/or subsistence in the interim? 

 I am flying out of Canada to Europe and will probably use AIG travelguard.

My question operates under the assumption that since I booked two flights separately, that the first carrier would not compensate me as described.

I understand that had I booked under one ticket, the carrier is effectively guaranteeing that I will reach my ultimate destination, albeit not at the expected time/date."

I was hoping to get some feedback from people who have flown long flights on these carriers. Someone who has flown this exact route would be awesome!

We'd like the best flight experience possible, (we're both a little nervous about this plane trip) but can't afford to upgrade from coach. Icelandair's food and entertainment policy doesn't bother us.

We really appreciate any insights you might be able to share. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for the input guys! We just booked and ended up going with the Lufthansa flight. It was just easier to manage buying something vs. monkeying with the miles. Plus the Lufthansa is direct which is nice when you really want to get there, and probably easier if your husband has to be a little drugged :P

I'll be attending my friend's wedding in Bulgaria on June 3rd, so I plan on making it an extended vacation with my girlfriend; leaving June 1st and flying back on June 9th or 10th.

I've found that direct flights to Sofia, Bulgaria are quite expensive, so we had the idea of flying into a cheaper location in Europe, and then catching another flight in to Sofia. This way, we can also use that intermediate city as the location for the extended vacation portion of the trip, after the wedding. We will be flying out of the California Bay area, so we have SFO, Oakland, and San Jose that we can potentially leave out of. Looking for insight into a cheap city to land at in Europe (that would also be a location that would be good for vacationing for about a week) that we can also find a cheap flight from there into Sofia.
